VOCATIONAL SKILLS

These new skills are suitable for characters whose abilities are not limited to the battlefield.

Some of them are used between games. Doing so will require a Trader to use Skill pegs as usual,
meaning that they must have pegs spare at the end of a mission. Each Trader may only use one Skill
between games for each Career level they have. The phase they can be used in is marked in bold. If
not used between games the Skill points are wasted.

This Skill type can be used for creating custom Traders and Classes as detailed in the Deluxe Rules,
and can also be found in some of the new Classes in the Shift Change at MegaCorp pack.
