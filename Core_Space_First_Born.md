At the furthermost tip of the Perseus Arm of our galaxy burns a small white star. Here lie the remnants of the
First Born, an advanced civilization that conquered the galaxy long ago but found that they were utterly alone.
In despair they receded, and their great society was brought low by civil war. One war-like faction placed
themselves into suspended animation and waited.

For millions of years they slept as the younger species took their first steps into space. But the sleep wasn’t
dreamless and the First Born were slowly driven mad. Fanatical and paranoid, they have learned to fear and
despise the new species that they once longed for.

When the Traders arrived in a seemingly abandoned asteroid field to pick over the bones of a long-dead
people, the First Born were awoken…

The Traders will have no choice but to again rely on their simple credo:

SALVAGE // TRADE // ADAPT // SURVIVE

When the Traders have taken
their actions, the game fights
back! The First Born are
just one of many types of
NPC – non-player characters
controlled by the game’s
mechanics. The ancient First
Born will fight to eject you
from their consecrated home,
whereas other NPCs will have
their own objectives,
or may just get caught up in
the firefight!

While all of this is going on,
the game’s Hostility level
will be rising. As each
peg is placed into the
Hostility Tracker, the First
Born will become even
more dangerous, as will
the unpredictable events
arising from the game’s
event deck each round.

DRONE ACTIVITY
PATROL
Patrol: Place one Drone at a random Patrol Point.
INSPECTION
React: The nearest Drone to a Trader
makes a Ranged Assault against that Trader,
if possible.
WAKE PROTOCOLS
Focused Assault: The nearest Liege to
a Trader makes an immediate Ranged
Assault against that Trader, if possible,
rolling one additional die. The Knowledge Die
is not used and will still be used in the First
Born Phase.
THREAT DEFENCE   CLEANSE
Warp Shift: The Iconoclast furthest
from and not engaged with a Trader
phases – move it to the nearest Entry
Point to a Trader.

The heart of Core Space
is its characters. The
campaign system will allow you to take your crew
through a series of games, getting to know them,
developing their skills, upgrading their equipment,
maintaining their ship and building their story.

Core Space: First Born is compatible with the wide
range of other Core Space products available.
Although First Born is a solo,
self-contained game, the
rules are designed to cover
all options. You will therefore
see references throughout
the book that explain how to
play with multiple players, or
that refer to types of character
or token that are not found in
this set.

For more on combining this
game with other Core Space
sets, see page 89.

GAME OVERVIEW

IMPORTANT!
If this is your first adventure
in the Core Space universe,
we recommend you
start out by reading the
accompanying Learn to
Play booklet. This will
take you through the
components and basic
mechanics step-by-
step, ready to hit the
ground running with the full
Core Space experience.

OVERVIEW
“We run in, we grab as much loot as we can,
then we run out, if we’re lucky we won’t have to
fire a single shot!”
Core Space is a sci-fi miniatures game, playable
solo, co-operatively, or PvP. The players take
control of a small band of Traders fighting for
survival in a dangerous galaxy. In First Born, your
crew venture into an asteroid field on the fringes of
known space, but the ancient temples they find are
not as abandoned as they seem…
Core Space is played in a series of narrative
missions with varying objectives, including
searching for artefacts, defeating powerful
enemies, or even just escaping to survive another
day! The enemies, the First Born in this case, are
controlled by the game, allowing the players to
focus on the wide cast of characters.

READ THIS FIRST!

All of this takes place on the immersive and
interactive 3D gaming board that will bring your
table to life. Once you know your way around
you can even play a campaign of linked games,
developing your characters along the way.
LEARNING TO PLAY
This book is intended as an introduction to Core
Space and can be played by 1-2 players. We
recommend that new players set up the starter
scenario shown in this book to learn the basics
We’ll take you through the first few rounds of
the game, and then leave you to complete the
mission using everything you’ve learned. We
suggest playing through this introductory mission
a few times, trying different tactics, before
tackling everything else the game has to offer in
the main rulebook.

Core Space is a science fiction miniatures board
game set in the frontier worlds on the fringes of
known space, 1500 years in the future. In First
Born, your crew venture into an asteroid field on
the fringes of known space, but the ancient temples
they find are not as abandoned as they seem…

Each player will take control of a small band
of Traders fighting for survival. This starter set
contains one Trader crew, for a single person flying
solo or up to four players playing cooperatively.
Additional crews can be purchased separately to
accommodate up to six players.

Core Space is played in a series of narrative
missions. Your group of Traders will be presented
with a set of objectives and a map of the area,
showing how to set out the detailed 3D gaming
board. They will need to venture out from their ship,
complete the objectives and get back to safety.
That last part is vital!

Each round the players will take actions with their
Traders – moving, shooting and exploring the
board. The Traders’ abilities are tracked using the
game’s unique Character Dashboards, and the
success of their actions is determined by rolling the
various dice.

THE FIRST BORN
The First Born are an ancient race that lived for millennia across the
expanse of the galaxy. Their advanced technology was matched only by
their just society and ability to live in harmony with nature.

Tragically, they never once encountered another intelligent species and came to
the conclusion that they were alone in the universe. This slowly gnawed at them,
and over time their society faded and fell into ruin. Countless civil wars followed;
the old ways were forgotten, the harmony so long fought for was swept aside
and wisdom replaced with madness. Into the power vacuum stepped the Godly,
a fanatical sect that thrived in the last years of the First Born empire. Eventually
they were outlawed and driven from First Born space to the Perseus-
Orion arm of the galaxy where they hid themselves and waited.

These fearsome warriors are the First Born your
Traders will encounter.

TERRAIN
You were introduced to the terrain in the Learn to Play booklet, but let’s find out a bit more about Core
Space’s immersive 3D gaming area.

The game is built to work with Battle Systems’ wide range of modular terrain. It is made from sturdy full-
colour board and can be assembled without glue or prior hobby knowledge.

The first time you play you will need to remove all the walls, small terrain pieces, character boards
and counters from the card sheets. Some of the small terrain pieces require basic assembly.

The starter set comes with enough terrain to fill a standard two foot by two foot gaming area, and to play
all of the missions in this book. Here is a board set up to play the Exploration mission from page 48.

Each Core Space mission includes a map showing how to set up the board, with the walls assembled in a
simple grid to match the map using the plastic clips provided.

The edge of the playing area is considered to be a wall for rules purposes, but you do not need to
physically place walls around the edges.

You will need to allow approximately 15-20 minutes to set up the playing area before each game.

4

STANDALONE TERRAIN
As well as walls, Core Space also uses smaller pieces of standalone terrain. In the game these pieces
can be interacted with in various ways to help or hinder you with your objectives, and will also provide
cover from enemy fire!

These pieces often require assembly to stand upright on the board. The components simply push together
but may need to be bent or folded first.

Detailed tutorial videos for all the terrain pieces can be found on the Battle Systems website.

Once you’ve got everything together you will have the following:

Exhaust Vents

Stasis Pods

Arks

True Born
Stasis Pod

Command Console

Pillars

Dyson Reactor

Each of these terrain pieces can be interacted with in the game, and their rules can be found on page 90.

GLOSSARY
Throughout this book you will see certain words
that mean a specific thing within the context of the
rules. It will be beneficial to know them in advance
so they are listed for you here:

Player: The real-life person controlling a crew.

Character: Any single miniature.

Crew: The group of characters controlled by a player.

Trader: A character that is part of a player’s crew.

NPC: A non-player character controlled by the
game’s AI, including the First Born.

Rank: The power level of an NPC shown
on their board with the icon on the right.
Higher-ranked NPCs tend to act before
lower-ranked ones.

First Player: The first player will take actions and
make certain decisions on behalf of everyone
playing, including but not limited to:

•  Drawing and resolving Event Cards.
•  Taking the first action in each Trader Phase.
•  Choosing between multiple equally valid actions
for NPCs, such as which enemy to attack if
there are two equidistant targets.
If a card or rule allows multiple players to
make an action, the first player goes first,
proceeding clockwise.

•

The rules will define many situations where the
first player can make a decision. In addition, in any
situation where players cannot agree on how to
resolve a rule, the first player has final say.

The first player is determined at the start of the
game. In each Assessment Phase control is passed
to the next player clockwise around the table, who
will be first player for the next round. You should
use a marker such as a coin or spare miniature
to mark the first player, and physically pass this
around the table during the game.

Mission: A single game of Core Space.

Round: A collection of phases that repeats
throughout the game, allowing all characters to act.

Phase: A specific part of a round where certain
groups of characters will act and certain rules will
come into play.

Activation: The prompt for a character to take
their turn.

6

Turn: The time in which an individual character is
activated and takes actions.

Action: A self-contained ‘thing’ that a character
does. The number of actions a character can take
in a turn will be limited, unless the action is marked
as ‘free’.

Enemy: A character from an opposing crew or
group of NPCs. Characters will often be restricted
from taking certain actions while enemies are
nearby. The rules for each NPC type will list who
classes them as an enemy. The First Born consider
everyone an enemy!

Square: Core Space is usually played on a board
with an overlaid grid of 25mm squares, used to
measure movement and other distances.

In situations where you are required to move or
measure at an angle not in line with the squares,
follow the closest route possible in that chosen
direction. If there are multiple equally valid routes,
the first player decides.

EXAMPLE

This Liege is required to move in the
direction shown on the die and will
therefore follow the path shown. As this
Liege cannot move through terrain, it will
move around the Ark.

MEASURED MOVEMENT
These rules are written to use the gridded
gaming mat included in the box. If you prefer,
you can ignore the grid on the board and use a
ruler or tape measure for movement instead.

Any reference to squares will instead refer to
inches, for example characters will move up to
4 inches instead of 4 squares.

Characters and items are considered to be
adjacent or engaged only when in actual
base contact.

If you choose to play on an alternative terrain
set that doesn’t have a grid this will be the
default way of playing.

Adjacent: Squares next to each other without
intervening terrain are adjacent, including
diagonally, so each square will have up to eight
adjacent squares. Squares either side of a wall
are not adjacent unless there is a door or other
opening in between.

Engaged: Enemy
characters in orthogonally
adjacent squares (not
diagonally adjacent) are
engaged. This means they
are involved in combat with
one another, which will affect
the actions they can take.

Attack: A dice roll made
against a character in order to
inflict damage. Usually made via
an Assault action, but attacks can
be generated from other sources
as well.

Target: The focus of a particular
attack or action.

 icons on the combat dice.

Hit: Potential damage represented
by
Hits can be affected by rules such
as armour and cover.

Damage: Actual wounds sustained from hits
after other rules have been accounted for.

Prone: A character that has fallen or been
knocked off their feet. They will be laid on
their side.

Defeated: A character who is out of the game, at
least temporarily. Defeated Traders are laid on
their side but left on the board. Defeated NPCs are
removed from play.

D6: A standard six-sided die, in this case the purple
Knowledge die numbered 1-6. If a rule refers to a
D6, it means to roll the Knowledge Die and use the
number rolled.

Scatter: Moving a character or item in a random
direction determined by the Knowledge Dice (see
page 11).

UA: Universal Asset – the game’s currency, used
for hiring crew members and trading equipment
between games.

May: Any rule that uses the word ‘may’ is
optional, and the player can choose not to use it
if they wish. Otherwise, all rules must be applied
in full, if possible.

CREW DASHBOARDS
Each Trader has their own Character Board which fits
into the Crew Dashboard. The dashboard is split into
four sections: Trader Board, Items, Class and Pegs.

POINTS
Points are the value of a character’s total worth,
used when selecting a crew (see page 50). The
Points value is located at the bottom left corner of
the Trader Board.

TRADER BOARD
The Trader Board shows the Trader’s statistics and
personal details. Note that the reverse of the board
shows the Trader in their Civilian guise (see the
NPC Phase on page 40).

SPECIES AND TYPE
The character’s species is listed at the top of
the board, and the type (Captain or Crew) at the
bottom. Certain rules may refer to these attributes.

STATISTICS
These are depicted with a series of circles and include
the character’s Health, Action, Skill, and Career.

Health represents the character’s toughness and
stamina and shows how much damage they can
take before they are defeated.

Action shows how many actions (see page 20) the
character can make each round.

Skill shows how many specialised Skills (see page
31) the character can use in a game.

Career represents everything the character has
learned during their time in the crew and affects
how many Skills they can learn, as well as
improving their other statistics later in a campaign
(see page 60).

DEFAULT VS. POTENTIAL
You will notice that each statistic has some spaces
filled out with an inner circle (default), and some
left blank (potential).

Default spaces represent the character’s starting
abilities – the inner circles should be filled in with a
dry-wipe pen at the start of a game.

Potential spaces represent the character’s ability to
improve in a campaign. These spaces can be filled
in to add points to the character’s statistics.

A character can never exceed their potential, but
they can drop below their default!

8

BASE ABILITIES
In addition to any Skills granted by their Class,
some characters also start with Skills or abilities
as standard, shown in the bottom left. Skills will
be pre-marked with a certain level (see the Class
Board) and work in exactly the same way.
You may also see some additional icons such
as the one to the right, which are covered in
more detail on page 101.

ARMOUR SLOT
The Trader Board has an area in the bottom right
corner that may be punched out, leaving space
for an armour token. Armour will grant additional
protection to the character when attacked, and
its rules only apply when placed in this slot. Most
armour tokens are yellow, but others will be marked
Armour on the back.

However, don’t discard the piece that you have
removed! Many characters have an additional
base ability in this area which will be in effect
whenever they are not weighed down by armour.

ITEMS
The items that a character starts with or
collects during a game are stored here.
There is an actual, physical limit – the
character cannot carry more items than
the tray can hold! Larger items such as
rifles take up more space, so use this
area wisely.

CLASS
The Class Board represents the character’s
profession and specialisation, and therefore the
type of Skills available to them.

Each of the coloured icons represents a Skill (see
page 93). The spaces around it can be marked with
the pen to show the character’s proficiency with
that Skill from Level 1 to 3. When selecting a crew
(see page 50) the player will fill in a number of these
spaces equal to the Trader’s current Career points. As
the character’s Career advances in a campaign, more
points can be allocated to the Class Board to learn
new Skills or upgrade existing ones.

The second row shows the character’s Skill, using the
purple pegs. Like Health, this is set at the start of the
game to match the Skill statistic. If there are no pegs
remaining, the character may no longer use Skills.

The bottom row shows the amount of ammo carried
by the character, using the yellow pegs. Characters
always start the game with a full magazine of
ammo, but this will change as weapons are fired
and reloaded. If there are no pegs remaining, the
character may not fire their ranged weapons.

PEGS
The statistics on the Trader
Board are fixed during play, and
the in-game action instead takes
place down here. These holes
are filled with the plastic pegs to
show the fluctuating state of the
character’s abilities.

The top row shows the character’s Health, using
the green pegs. At the start of a game pegs are
added to match the character’s current Health
statistic and pegs may be removed or added during
the game as the character takes damage. If there
are no pegs remaining on their Board, the character
is defeated. Unless stated otherwise, a character
can never exceed their current Health statistic.

EXAMPLE
•  Cassie has a default Health statistic of 5 but the

potential to raise it to 7. It is currently at 6.

•  She has 2 default Actions, but the potential for 3.

•  She has a default of 4 Skill points, and the
potential for 6, with 5 marked currently.

•  She has a default Career of 4 points, currently
has 10 points, and has a maximum of 17!

•  Cassie has three base abilities – Evade Level 1,
Weapons Expert Level 2, and Slippery Level 1.

•

In addition, she has
This gives her an armour value even when not
carrying an armour token!

 a icon in her armour slot.

•  Cassie is carrying a Common Pistol and a

Medi Stim.

•  Cassie has allocated her 10 Career points to 7

different Skills in the Marine class:

She is Level 1 in Counter Shot, Kata,
Reflexes and Stubborn.

She is also Level 1 in Weapons Expert, which
combined with her base ability gives her
Level 3!

She is Level 2 in Marksman.

She is Level 3 in Walk it Off.

•  Cassie will start a game with 6 Health pegs
(equal to her Health statistic), 5 Skill pegs
(equal to her Skill statistic), and 7 ammo pegs
(a full magazine).

KEY CONCEPTS
HOSTILITY
The Hostility Tracker is used to gauge the aggression
of the First Born. The higher the Hostility, the more
deadly and numerous the First Born become. The
tracker increases by 1 point each round, marked
using the black pegs, and will increase by a further 1
following the first shot fired by a Trader each round (if
any), as the noise draws the First Born closer.

There are 6 Hostility levels:

ICON KEY

 Drone

 Liege

 Iconoclast

True Born

 Cerberosa

 Talos

 First Born Die

 Knowledge
Die

Inspection

•  Patrol
•
•  Aware
•  Wake Protocols
•  Threat Defence
•  Cleanse

Each of these includes a number of icons indicating
the character type(s) that arrive in the First Born
Phase (see page 33).

If an icon is followed by a number, that many
characters will be placed. If the icon is followed
by a die icon, roll that die to determine how many
characters of that type will appear.

The Hostility level will also determine the effect of
Event Cards each turn (see page 19).

If the Hostility level reaches Cleanse, turn the First
Born Board over to the ‘Cleanse’ side – from now
on these First Born will have increased statistics.

THE HOSTILITY BOARD
You will notice that the Hostility Board has two
sides. The side shown here should be used for
any games using only the starter set. The reverse
side should be used when you want a bit more of
a challenge and have incorporated the additional
First Born types into your games.

10

COMBAT DICE
There are two types of combat dice; blue and red.
These are mostly used for Assault (see page 22),
but you may sometimes need to roll them for other
reasons, as detailed in specific rules.

RANDOM DIRECTIONS AND SCATTER
The Knowledge Die can also be used to determine
random directions – the chosen direction will be
shown by the arrow on the die face after it has
stopped moving.

The blue die is always used
as part of a roll. If only a
single die is required, only the
blue dice is rolled.

If more than one die is
required, all additional dice will
be red. Red dice are not quite
as powerful as blue dice.

Some rules will ask you to scatter an item or
character. To do so, simply roll the Knowledge
Die. The item or character in question is moved a
number of squares from its current position using
the number and direction shown on the die.

If this movement would cause it to hit a wall,
another model, or any other obstruction, it will
move as far as it can and stop.

There are two different icons on the dice:

•  Each
•  Each

 icon is a hit.
 icon is a misfire, and will often have

an adverse effect.

Blanks are failures and have no effect.

CHANCE AND RANDOMISATION
In Core Space you will often be asked to choose
a crew, Trader or item at random. This
is done using the numbers
on the Knowledge Die
to generate a result.

6

Ignore the icons and arrows on the die for these rolls.

This is a simple way of deciding random actions
and keeps the game moving fast. If you come up
against a situation not covered by the rules, or
something that you cannot decide on, just roll the
Knowledge Die to see what happens.

EXAMPLE
One member of the Eidolon is affected by a
technical failure. There are 3 crew members
in play. Roll the Knowledge Die. On a 1-2 it’s
Cassie, 3-4 it’s Balcor and on a 5-6 it’s Hopper.
If there were 4 members you could roll 1 for
Cassie, 2 for Balcor, 3 for Hopper and 4 for
Wade, re-rolling the die on a 5 or 6.

LINE OF SIGHT
There are various rules in Core Space that require
miniatures to see each other, such as firing a
ranged weapon. This is called line of sight (or LoS
for short).

For a character to draw line of sight, you must be
able to trace a straight line from the centre of their
square to any part of the target character’s square.
You can use the range ruler to trace this line to
ensure it is straight.

Breach Rifle

If you cannot draw a line to any part of the target
without being completely obstructed by another
character, wall, or a piece of terrain at least as
tall as the target, line of sight cannot be drawn.

Note that all characters are considered to be the
same height for LoS purposes unless they are
Massive (see page 101). The entire area above
their base blocks LoS, regardless of their pose.

If you can only draw a line to part of the target, or
the line is obstructed by a piece of terrain shorter
than the target (such as a crate), check the cover
rules on the next page to see if line of sight can
be drawn.

Combat Rifle

The exception to this rule is that characters can
ignore pieces of terrain shorter than themselves if
they are adjacent (so a model next to an Ark can
fire over it without penalty for example). The same
applies to other members of their crew in adjacent
squares – it is assumed that they will get their
comrade to duck!

Character A’s LoS to target B is only
partially blocked as B can be seen past the
Ark - refer to the cover rules. LoS to target
C is completely blocked by the wall. A’s LoS to
D is clear.

12

A has clear LoS to target C. However, A’s
LoS to B and D is partially obscured by the
terrain - refer to the cover rules.

COVER
Often terrain and walls will partially block line of
sight, but enough of the target may be visible for a
shot to be taken. In this case, the target is in cover.
The amount of cover may have an impact on the
attack or action being made as follows:

•

•

•

If 25% of the target or less is obstructed, this is
insufficient cover. Line of sight can be drawn
as normal and no further rules will apply.
If between 25% and 90% of the target is
obstructed (such as them hiding behind a crate
or bulkhead), this is partial cover. Line of sight
can be drawn, but additional rules may apply
(see Ranged Assault on page 25 for example,
where partial cover will reduce hits by 1).
If 90% or more of a target is obstructed, they
are in full cover – line of sight cannot be
drawn at all.

Insufficient
Cover

Partial
Cover

Full
Cover

Note that prone characters will be affected by cover
based on their prone position, so a waist-high crate
may provide full cover to a prone character.

If you cannot decide what type of cover a target is
in, roll the Knowledge Die – on a 1-3 it’s the larger
amount of cover, and on a 4-6 it’s the smaller amount.

RANGE
For most weapons line of sight isn’t enough – they will also be limited by
range – depending on the distance to the target the weapon may be more or
less powerful or be unable to hit at all. Although you can count the squares in
a straight line, this can be harder to do when shooting diagonally. The plastic
range rulers are provided for this purpose. Place the range ruler touching the
shooting character’s base, and as long as it reaches any part of the target’s
base the target is in range.

•  Short range is up to 5 squares – the length of the shorter ruler.
•  Medium range is from 5-13 squares – the length of the longer ruler.
•  Long range is 13 squares or more – anywhere further than the length of the

longer ruler.

On page 15 you will see how range is displayed on the weapon tokens.

EQUIPMENT
Equipment is one of the most important features
of Core Space, represented by the small square
and rectangular tokens in the game. Each of these
is a weapon or more specialised item that can be
carried by Traders and other characters.

FIRST BORN EQUIPMENT
Most equipment tokens in this edition of the game
are green. These peculiar objects are the weapons,
armour and artefacts of the First Born. Not being of
standard galactic origin they cannot be purchased
and can only be obtained by looting the First Born
asteroid temples.

 icon should

The tokens marked with a
be kept separately. This is the personal
equipment of the True Born – you’ll have
to defeat one to get it! For more on the
True Born see page 38.

Otherwise the First Born equipment of both sizes
– regular square items and small ‘nano’ tokens –
is used for populating the Arks and other terrain
pieces at the start of each game. The remaining
standard tokens are then placed into the Token
Pouch to be found during the game. For more on
setting up the game see page 16.

When picked up by a Trader, First Born equipment
works in the same way as its standard equivalent
– as a weapon, armour or special item, with two
exceptions:

•  First Born items ignore all the effects of

results on the dice, so they will never jam
or break.

•  First Born weaponry cannot be combined

with items that upgrade standard
weaponry such as the Target Laser.

14

STANDARD EQUIPMENT
You will also see a lot of tokens in other colours.
This is standard equipment and should be
kept separately to the First Born tokens. This
equipment is used to kit out your crew at the start
of a campaign and can also be purchased at the
Trading Post between games.

The colour of each token denotes how it is used in
the game:

Blue: Weapons – these will be held in
your item tray and used to make Assault
actions.

Yellow: Armour – can be held in the item
tray, but its rules will only apply when in
the armour slot.

Orange: Special Items – this covers
any other equipment used during the
game, from Ammo Mags to Medi-Stims to
Sensor Goggles.

Purple: Non-combat equipment such
as money or ship parts – these items
are not used during the game, but they
will be useful for trading and maintaining
your ship when the mission is finished,
so you’ll need to allow space for them in
your item tray.

Light Green: Objectives – these
tokens are only used where specified in
missions, to represent a vital asset that
the crews are trying to retrieve. They
have no in-game effect unless otherwise
stated. Traders will have to carry these off
of the board to win.

On the back of each equipment token
you will see the cost of the item. This
is used when trading in a campaign
(see page 61). First Born and Rare
(
have a buy value.

) items cannot be bought and do not

ANCIENT MINERALS
You will also notice a set of small equipment
tokens with a grey rock texture. These
represent the minerals that can be mined
from the walls of the asteroid using the
Mine action (see page 26). During the
game they are kept in the token pouch
with the standard First Born tokens.

STATISTICS AND ICONS
Throughout Core Space you will see various
numbers and icons – on Trader Boards, equipment
tokens, or in this rulebook.

CLOSE ASSAULT WEAPONS
The first two numbers are the number of combat
dice used by the weapon in a Close Assault action
(see page 24), when making a standard or heavy
hit respectively.

NPC STATISTICS
Unlike Traders, NPCs do not make complex actions
or use items, so their statistics are much simpler.
There are four values that you will see across all
NPC Boards, whether it’s the First Born, Game
Hunters, or lowly Civilians. These boards should be
kept to the side of the board in view of all players.

This is the number of actions that an
NPC can take each turn. Note that
NPCs do not always use their actions
when they activate.

The number of dice that an NPC rolls
for a Close Assault action.

The number of dice that an NPC rolls
for a Ranged Assault action.

The physical armour value of the NPC
which negates hits made against them.

This value is used when Traders attempt
to Persuade the NPC to do something.
This is covered in more detail on page
27. Characters with no Persuade statistic
cannot be Persuaded.

Standard

Heavy

Throw

The third box is the number of combat dice used
when throwing the weapon (see page 30). If there
is no number shown, the weapon cannot be used
in that way.

ARMOUR

A physical armour value will reduce the
number of hits against the wearer by the
value shown.

A shield armour value will reduce the
number of hits by the value shown, but if
the value is beaten the shield is inactive for
the rest of the mission.

A combat value means that this armour
allows the wearer to make unarmed Close
Assault actions.

For more on armour, see page 23.

BLAST WEAPONS
For more on blast weapons, see page 30.

While some NPCs can carry items, they cannot use
them – they will only use the statistics above.

WEAPON STATISTICS
Like characters, weapons and armour also have
statistics, shown in the following ways.

The number of
combat dice or
effect used on
the target of
the attack.

The smaller
numbers show the
number of combat
dice used on
characters within 1
and 2 squares of the
target respectively.

RANGED WEAPONS

Short Medium Long

This is the number of combat
dice used by the weapon in a
Ranged Assault action (see
page 25), at short, medium

and long range respectively. If there is no number
shown, the weapon cannot be used at that range.

ICONS
Many characters and items will have specialised
icons in addition to their statistics. These icons
represent abilities that the character or item can
perform over and above the standard rules.

For example, the Burst Fire icon allows
you to add an additional combat die to a

weapon’s attack by spending an additional ammo
peg, increasing your chances of overcoming an
enemy’s armour!

A full list of the game’s icons can be found on
page 101.

sets and can often be added to missions.
6.  Under the mission map you will see a section

titled ‘Event Cards’.

The card types are denoted by
the icon in the bottom corner.
Sometimes all cards of a
certain type will be used,
and sometimes a number of cards will
be specified in which case draw them
randomly from those available.
If you have chosen to use additional NPCs in the
mission, add their cards to the deck.
Shuffle the selected cards together and place
the deck face down at the side of the board.

7.  If you are playing solo, skip this step. If you

are using multiple crews, decide amongst the
players who will deploy their crew first.

The chosen player can choose any airlock
position on the map to be their starting
point. The other players then choose their
starting points, proceeding clockwise
around the table.

SETTING UP THE GAME
Core Space is played using a series of missions
–scenarios with pre-set objectives. These can be
played as a continuous narrative (see page 54), but
most people start out by playing one-off games.

Some missions may have additional rules, but
otherwise follow this process to set up a game:

1.  Read through the Missions section of this book
on page 44, or the mission briefings that come
with other Core Space sets, and select the
one you want to play. For your first game, we
suggest you start with the Exploration mission
on page 48.

2.  Lay out the gaming mat(s) and terrain as shown
on the map. You can find the key on page 45.
Around the edges of the board you will
see ship Airlock positions. In missions with
multiple crews, do not put your ship in position
just yet – you’ll do that in step 7. Otherwise
place your Ship Airlock Board now, in any of
the positions available.
Do not place Arks, Crates, or any other terrain
that contains equipment just yet.

3.  The terrain pieces you set aside in step 2 are

now filled with equipment.

Firstly, if the missions specifies any ‘Key Items’,
these should be set aside. The mission briefing
will provide further information.
Each type of terrain
piece will have a
diagram under the
mission map listing its
contents, like this:
The numbers in the
small boxes tell you how many
nano tokens to use, and the
numbers in the larger boxes tell
you how many standard tokens to
use. Using the example above,
each terrain piece would contain two
standard tokens and one nano token
(as well as a rune for the Command
Console - see page 92).
Remove the lids from the terrain pieces.
Then, without looking, draw this number
of tokens from their respective pools at
random and place them into each terrain
piece, closing the lid afterwards.
All remaining standard First Born tokens
should be put into the token pouch along
with all the grey mineral tokens. The green
nano tokens will not be used during the
game and can be returned to the box.

Standard

Nano

4.  Players should now place all Searchable terrain
pieces into the positions shown on the map.

8.  Each player should now select their crew

11. Place the following components within easy

(see page 50 for more details). Players place
their dashboards in front of them with the
appropriate Trader and Class Boards in place.
Their Ship Airlock Board should be placed
airlock side up (see page 57) in line with their
chosen starting location, and the miniatures
should be placed in their airlock.

9.  Each player should place pegs into their crew

dashboards – Health and Skill pegs equal to
the characters’ statistics, and full magazines of
ammo. Unless playing a Rescue Mission (page
46), pegs are always reset to their full values at
the start of a game.

10. Roll the Knowledge Die and place a First Born

Drone on the matching Patrol Point – it will start the
game in play.

First Born Miniatures and Boards
NPC Miniatures and Boards set aside in step 5
Key Items set aside in step 3
Token Pouch
Range Rulers
Dice
Assorted Counters

All remaining miniatures, character boards,
terrain and other components will not be required
for play and can be returned to the box.

12. Finally, it’s time to start the game. The player
that deployed last will be the first player in the
first round. Off you go!

Note: These rules explain how to set up a game
in First Born space. If you are playing a game in
a different setting or using a different starter set,
alternative set up rules can be found in other Core
Space rulebooks.

ENDING A MISSION
Missions will list various objectives but these do not
necessarily have to be completed to end a mission.
Sometimes it will be all you can do to escape with
your lives!

Unless specified otherwise in the mission briefing,
a game will end immediately when all Traders are
either defeated or are back on board their ships.

MORE WAYS TO PLAY
Core Space is a sandbox. Although we’ve set out
the rules, missions and objectives, feel free to
play around with them. Once you are comfortable
with the core rules, you may wish to take your
game from a board game to an RPG and use the
Core Space framework to tell your own stories!
The only real limit is your imagination – if there
is something you want your character to do, just
agree with your fellow players how to handle it,
and go ahead!

ADDING A GAME MASTER
Some players, especially those that have
designed the mission and its storyline, may
prefer to take more of an overseer role and not
control a crew themselves. Instead you may
choose to ignore the AI rules, and this player
would take control of the First Born and other
NPCs themselves. This can make for some really
exciting games.

18

DON’T BE A HERO
You will quickly learn that Core Space is all about
survival. You can’t always go in all guns blazing,
or expect to loot every last crate on the board. The
game can, and will, turn on you. One of the most
important lessons to learn in Core Space is when
to run away, to ensure you’ve still got a crew left to
play the next mission. You’ve been warned!

WINNING AND LOSING
If a crew was entirely wiped out (all of their Traders
were defeated), that player automatically loses.

Otherwise, if the Primary Objective of a mission
is completed, the player(s) that completed it have
won. If the Primary Objective was not completed,
all players have lost.

In a multiplayer game, if multiple players
completed the Primary Objective (or nobody
did) you may still want to determine an overall
winner – the player who won the most, or who
lost least! This player may gain benefits in
the following game such as the first choice of
deployment position.

Of course, in a campaign winning and losing is
not quite so simple – you can lose a game but still
come out on top in the end if you play it right! The
campaigns section on page 54 will go into this in
more detail.

TWEAKING MISSIONS
The nature of Core Space’s mechanics, with the
unpredictable dice rolls and Event Cards, mean
that in theory you could play the same mission a
dozen times and every game will be different. So,
if you want a quick game without investing time
into designing a mission, you don’t have to!

Just by making small tweaks to the pre-
generated missions, you can create a wildly
different experience and massively increase the
game’s replayability.

Here are some examples of things you could do:

•  Change the starting Hostility Level.
•  Adding in different NPCs.
•  Switching out Event Cards.
•  Changing the number of starting crew.

In short, you can do anything you want, as long as
you and the other players agree to it beforehand.
There are some more examples in the Advanced
Rules section in the Deluxe Rulebook.

Order Of Play
Each mission is played in a series of rounds during
which all characters on the board will get to act. Each
round is broken down into the following phases:

1.  Hostility
2.  Trader
3.  First Born
4.  NPC
5.  Assessment

1. HOSTIlITy PHaSe
As the game goes on, the First Born will become
more aware of your presence. In this phase, start by
adding 1 black peg into the first empty space on the
Hostility Tracker.

Note: In multiplayer games, you must add 1 peg
for every three crews, rounding up, so you would
add 1 peg per round with 1-3 crews, and 2 pegs per
round with 4-6 crews.

Then, the first player draws an Event Card.
Random events may help or impede the players’
progress. Some are merely a nuisance, but
others can be deadly and you will need to be
ready for them.

Depending on the current Hostility level, the card
may have different effects. Resolve all the effects
detailed for the current Hostility level. Once the
card is resolved, place it in a discard pile to the side
of the board, face up. If the deck ever runs out,
shuffle the discard pile to make a new deck.

Note the following:

If there is no target for
a rule, the rule has no
effect. If part of a card’s text can be resolved
but not all of it, resolve as much as possible
and then discard the card.
If for any reason, no part of a card’s text can
be resolved (for example
a card that moves a Drone
when there are none),
ignore the text. If there is
an icon at the end of the
paragraph, it will be used
to place a new character
instead, if possible. The
character will arrive as detailed on page 33 as
normal. Whether a character is placed or not,
shuffle the unresolved card back into the
deck and draw another.

2. Trader PHaSe
In the Trader Phase, players will take turns
to activate their Traders. The Trader Phase is
explored in more detail on page 20.

3. fIrST BOrN PHaSe
In the First Born Phase, more First Born will arrive
on the board and then they will attack. For full
details on the First Born Phase, see page 33.

4. NPC PHaSe
In the NPC Phase, all other NPCs controlled by the
game, such as Civilians and Game Hunters, will
act. See page 40 for how this works.

5. aSSeSSMeNT PHaSe
In the Assessment Phase the board is tidied up
ready for the following round.

•  All Activation Counters are removed.
•  Any other effects that state they happen ‘at the

end of the round’ will happen now.

•  The next player clockwise around the table

becomes the first player – they will be in control
for the following round.

TRADER PHASE
In the Trader Phase, the players take it in turns to
activate their Traders. The first player starts and
then play continues clockwise around the table,
each player activating one character at a time until
all Traders have been activated.

THE PLAYER’S TURN
When it is a player’s turn to activate a Trader, they
do the following:

1.  Choose one of their Traders to activate. This
cannot be a character that has been marked
with an Activation Counter.

2.  Take actions with the Trader, allowing them
to move, shoot, interact with the terrain, and
more. The following pages list the available
actions in detail.

3.  When you are finished, place an

Activation Counter on the Trader’s
dashboard to remind you that they
cannot act again this round.

4.  Play passes to the next player clockwise

around the table. When all Traders on the
board have been activated, move on to the
First Born Phase.

ACTIONS
A Trader’s Action statistic (see page 8) shows
how many actions they can take in a turn. Most
characters have two, but some have more. You
can choose to use all, some, or none of them when
activating your character.

The most common actions that can be taken are
as follows:

•  Move
•  Ranged Assault
•  Close Assault
•  Search
•  Mine
•  Knock Back
•  Reload
•  Persuade
Interact
•

Each of these is detailed on the following pages,
along with a few other less common actions.
Unless specified otherwise, there is no restriction to
the number of times that a particular action can be
taken, or the order they can be taken in.

In addition, a character can take effortless actions
– these do not count towards your action limit, but
you can usually only take one of them per turn –
see page 29.

PRONE CHARACTERS
Prone characters cannot take any actions other
than to Stand Up (see page 28), after which they
can act normally.

DEFEATED CHARACTERS
Defeated characters cannot take any actions at all
until they have been revived by another character.
For more on defeated characters, see page 32.

20

MOVE
When a character takes a Move action they can
move up to 4 squares. Characters can Move in any
direction, but cannot Move through or over terrain
unless specified otherwise (e.g. with the Scramble
rule on page 101). Characters can Move through
other friendly characters but cannot move through
enemies without permission (note that enemy
NPCs will never give permission).

Characters may only enter a square that is
completely empty – squares partially filled by
terrain at floor level are impassable.

Diagonal movement is allowed as long as
both of the squares to either side (that the
character would have to move through if moving
orthogonally) are empty.

The maximum Move is 11 squares. No matter how
many actions a character spends Moving, and
no matter what abilities they may have, they can
never voluntarily Move more than 11 squares in a
single round (they may still be Knocked Back by an
enemy or moved involuntarily by an effect).

Characters in orthogonally adjacent squares are
considered to be in base contact. Characters
in diagonally adjacent squares are not in base
contact. Enemies in base contact are considered
engaged (see page 7).

EXAMPLE

Characters on larger bases such as a Talos are
considered to take up four squares but otherwise
follow the same rules.

ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY
If a character leaves base contact with one or more
enemies, either at the start of or during their Move,
all standing, engaged enemies can make a free
Close Assault action (see page 24) against the
moving character, regardless of whether they have
already activated this turn. This action is resolved
immediately and does not use any of their actions
for the turn.

ENTERING AND LEAVING THE SHIP
Traders will start the game inside their ship’s
airlock. To enter the board, their first action of the
game must be a Move action starting from the
airlock door.

Traders that wish to return to their ship can
also do so with a Move action, moving up to the
airlock door with at least one square of movement
remaining to enter it. Note that once a character
has left the board and returned to their ship, they
are out of the game and cannot return.

Enemy Traders and NPCs may not enter a player’s
ship without their permission.

Wade wants to enter the nearby corridor using two Move actions. He cannot move through the
wall and the nearby stasis pod, but he can go around them as shown.

ASSAULT ACTIONS
An Assault action allows one character to attack
another. There are two types of Assault action – a
Close Assault action made with a character’s fists
or a hand-to-hand combat weapon, or a Ranged
Assault action made with a ballistic, chemical or
energy weapon.

 icons are rolled during an

Note that if a character has no value shown for a
certain attack type (no weapon and no base ability
on their character board), they cannot attack in
that way.

Both types are similar in execution, except for the
positioning of the attacker and their target. Each
allows the character to make an attack.

ATTACKS
Close Assault attacks can only be made against
enemies engaged with your character.

Ranged Assault attacks are made at a distance,
against targets within LoS and range of your
character’s weapon. They cannot be made against
targets engaged with your character.

Otherwise both types of attack are made in the
same way:

•  Roll combat dice for the weapon as shown
on its token (or on your character profile if
fighting unarmed). The number of
 icons
rolled are your hits.

•  Apply any applicable modifiers to the roll such as
cover (page 13) or armour (page 23), altering the
number of hits scored. Some special rules and
Skills may apply further modifiers.
•  Any remaining hits cause damage.

If targeting a Trader, reduce the target’s
Health by 1 for each point of damage. If their
Health reaches zero the character is defeated
– lay the character on their side. They will
remain there until moved or revived (see
page 32).
If targeting an NPC, unless stated otherwise
the character is instantly defeated and
removed from play if they take damage.
Any items they were carrying are left on the
ground where they fell.

Note that certain rules or cards will also call for
attacks to be made against a target. These are
carried out in the same way, but will specify the
number of dice to roll rather than referring to a
character or weapon. Unless stated otherwise,
such attacks do not have an origin and therefore
cover modifiers do not apply.

Ranged weapons are jammed – rotate the token
180° in your dashboard. Clearing a jammed ranged
weapon costs one action.

Close assault weapons are broken - flip the item
face down in the tray in your dashboard.

Broken weapons cannot be used again during this
game. They can only be repaired during the game
with a Repair action (see page 28). Otherwise,
they will be repaired automatically after the game if
playing a campaign.

If you are fighting unarmed, or your weapon has a

 icon (see page 102),

THE TRUE BORN
Defeating a True Born is a feat worthy of
renown. The first Trader to defeat a True Born
in a mission takes one of the True Born Kill
Counters, depending on whether the True
Born was in its awake or Somnambulant state
at the time.

True Born
(Somnambulant)

True Born
(Awake)

This counter is exchanged in the Advancement
Phase after the game – see page 60.

22

ARMOUR
Hits sustained in an attack can
be reduced by armour. There are
two types of armour, physical
and shield. Each token will have
numbers shown as follows:

Physical

Shield

Combat

Physical armour has a permanent affect while it
is worn, reducing the number of hits scored in an
attack against the wearer by the physical armour
value on the counter. For example, if a
character with a Combat Vest (physical
armour value of 1) suffers 2 hits, the
armour will deflect/absorb 1 of those
hits, but the other will get through and cause
damage. This will happen each time the character
is attacked.

Shield armour, however, is energy-based, and
if beaten will be rendered inactive for the rest of
the game.

If a character with shield armour takes hits up to
and including the shield armour value, the attack is
resolved just like physical armour above. However,
if enough hits get through to damage the wearer,
the shield has been overloaded and cannot be
used for the rest of the mission – flip the token
face down. It will recharge between missions in a
campaign. For example, if a character
with a Shield Belt (shield armour value
of 1) suffers 1 hit, it will be deflected as
normal and the armour will continue to
work. If the character suffers 2 hits, 1
would be deflected, 1 would cause damage, and
the armour would be rendered inactive.

If for any reason a character has both physical and
shield armour at the same time, they will use the
highest value available. If these values are equal,
the shield armour takes priority.

Some armour will also allow the character to attack
with it in Close Assault as detailed on the next page.

CLOSE ASSAULT
To attempt a Close Assault attack the enemy must be
engaged with your character , i.e. in an orthogonally
(not diagonally) adjacent square.

If your character has an unarmed combat
icon on their board you may use that, rolling
dice equal to the number inside.

Alternatively you may choose one
of your character’s close assault
weapons to attack with. You will then
choose whether you want to make a
standard hit or a heavy hit and roll the
number of dice shown.

Standard Hit

Heavy Hit

 results. Heavy hits
Standard hits ignore
have a chance of breaking the weapon and

 results will apply as normal.

Cover does not apply to Close Assault
attacks, but armour will apply as normal.

Note that some armour includes an
unarmed combat icon – this can be used
in a Close Assault attack like any other
weapon. These icons do not stack - a
character will use one or the other.

ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY

Don’t forget that if a character is engaged
with an enemy and moves away, the
enemy can make a free Close Assault
attack against it, following all the usual
rules. This attack is resolved immediately,
does not use any of that character’s actions
for the turn, and can be done even if the
attacking character has already activated.

EXAMPLE

In a two-player game, Wade uses his first action to move
into base contact with Lohbac, and his second to attack
Lohbac with his Utility Knife. This gives him one die. The
player rolls, but the result is a blank – Wade has failed to hit!

When it is Lohbac’s turn to activate, he may attack back
with his Combat Knife. However, to give him a chance to
really do some damage, he can use the weapon’s heavy
hit option to roll two dice instead. One of his hits will be
deflected by Wade’s Combat Vest, but with two dice he
has the potential to roll three hits! There is a chance that
the weapon might break, but the player thinks it’s worth
the risk.

If the characters survive the attacks, they will remain
engaged and continue to make Close Assault actions until
one of them chooses to Move away (attracting an attack of
opportunity), or one of them is defeated.

24

RANGED ASSAULT
To attempt a Ranged Assault attack the target must
be within range and LoS, and cannot be engaged
with your character. If you are engaged with one or
more other enemies while making a ranged attack,
they may make an attack of opportunity against
your character after your shot is resolved.

After the first Ranged Assault action made by a
Trader in each round, place the peg in the Hostility
Tracker instead of discarding it. You can easily
remember if this has happened already this round
because the last peg in the Hostility Tracker will
be yellow instead of black. Only one ammo peg is
placed in the Hostility Tracker per round.

You must choose one of your
character’s ranged weapons
to attack with and roll a
number of dice based on the
range between the shooter
and the target. Additional dice must be rolled if
accelerant ammo is being used – see page 104.

SHOOTING AT ENGAGED CHARACTERS

Characters that are engaged with each other will be
constantly moving, raining down blows or dodging
aside, and they make for difficult targets when
shooting.

If you want to shoot at an enemy engaged with
another character, check the following:

•  At short range, you can freely pick your target –
you are close enough to pick your moment and
aim straight.

•  At medium or long range, after rolling to hit you
must roll the Knowledge Die to determine which
of the combatants you have hit (even if one of
them is your own character!). Modifiers such as
cover and armour are worked out based on the
actual target hit.

Machine Pistol

The most common modifier applied to ranged
attacks is cover (see page 13). Partial cover will
reduce the number of hits on a target by 1. This is
always resolved before any other modifiers such
as armour.

Important: Making a ranged attack reduces your
ammo – remove an ammo peg from your dashboard.

EXAMPLE

Balcor fires at short range with an Outland Pistol, which
allows him to roll one die. He is firing at rival Trader,
Nerida, who is in partial cover and has no armour.

The player rolls the blue combat die and gets a single hit.
However, the partial cover reduces the number of hits by 1.
With zero hits, the attack does no damage.

In the next player’s turn Nerida shoots back. Balcor is in
clear LoS with no cover, but he has a permanent armour
value of 1. Nerida has a Combat Rifle, rolling two dice
(one blue, one red this time). She rolls one
and one
pistol and is ignored. Balcor’s armour will block one of
Nerida’s 2 hits but the other gets through. Balcor takes 1
damage and loses a Health peg.

to swap it with an item you already hold, place the
discarded item on the floor in a square adjacent to
your character.

Note: Most of the time the separation of ‘rooms’
on the board is obvious, but players may agree to
separate very large rooms or long corridors into
multiple areas that can each be Searched separately.

MINE
Searching isn’t the only way to find
valuable items in these ancient asteroid
temples. Any Trader carrying an item with
the
(i.e. without a door/opening) can Mine that wall for
precious minerals.

 icon and standing in contact with a solid wall

This works in exactly the same as making a
General Search except that you take one of the
small tokens from the bag instead, and
use a Mine Counter to mark the room.
Like Searching, each room can only be
Mined once, but a room can be Searched
and Mined separately.

Minerals have no use in game, but they can be sold
in the Trade Phase or combined to create powerful
new weapons combining First Born and standard
galactic technologies.

ROCK WORM LARVAE
Be careful when Searching and Mining
– you won’t always find treasure! You
may unearth a rock worm larva and get
a nasty bite! See page 105.

SEARCH
Search actions allow a character to look around
and find new items, and will often be the key to
victory in a mission. There are two types of Search:

SEARCH TERRAIN
Any terrain piece that has been loaded with
equipment before the game can be Searched,
including First Born Arks, Stasis Pods, and Cargo
Crates. Characters may Search any eligible terrain
piece they are in base contact with, as long as they
are not engaged with an enemy.

Open the terrain piece
and remove the contents,
keeping the tokens hidden
from other players. You
may add any or all of
the contents to your
character’s dashboard.
Any remaining items, and any of the character’s
own items that you no longer want or have room
for, are placed back into the terrain. Any items too
large to fit into the terrain piece are placed on the
ground in contact with it.

Terrain pieces can be Searched any number of
times in a game.

Note: If a First Born Stasis Pod is Searched
while the Hostility Level is still in Patrol, the stasis
field will be deactivated too early and the Liege
inhabiting the pod will die. Mark the pod with a
Search Counter – it will no longer spawn a Liege
later in the game (see page 91).

GENERAL SEARCH
Characters may also make a general Search of the
room they are in, as long as they are not engaged
with an enemy and there are no enemies in the room.
A room is defined as an area completely surrounded
by either walls or the edges of the board (ignoring
doors and windows). Each room can only
be searched once per mission – add a
Search Counter to the room to remind you
that it cannot be Searched again.

When you make a general Search, reach inside the
token pouch, without looking, and take a random
standard square item (not one of the smaller
tokens). You may add this to your character’s

26

PERSUADE
NPCs can often be persuaded to do certain things,
such as trade an item with you or even join your
crew. To do this you must be in base contact
with the NPC you are trying to Persuade and not
engaged with any other enemy.

Characters can be persuaded to:

•  Trade an item. If they
are carrying an item
you may swap it for
one of your own (small
items only). If they are
not carrying an item
you may draw one at
random from the token
pouch, and swap that
instead. If you don’t
want the item drawn,
leave it in the NPC’s
item slot and do not
make a trade.

•  Join your crew. If successful, the NPC will

assist your crew by acting as one of your crew
members for the remainder of the mission. See
Joining Crews on page 40 for full details. They
can be activated in the current round.
•  Make a mission-specific action: Some
missions will list extra things that you can
persuade an NPC to do. For example, you may
need to persuade a Civilian in a bar at Trading
Post 5 to provide vital intel.

The following icon represents how difficult
an NPC is to Persuade, and can be found
on their Character Board. Characters
without this icon cannot be Persuaded.

You must decide what you are Persuading a
character to do before rolling. Persuading a
character works similarly to an attack. The number
of combat dice rolled is equal to your character’s
Skill statistic (the value on their Character Board,
not the remaining number of pegs). The Persuade
value of the NPC works like armour, modifying
your roll. If your roll beats their Persuade value and
scores a hit, the action is successful.

KNOCK BACK
A Knock Back action allows you to shove or
misdirect an adjacent character, pushing them away.

To Knock Back another character, roll dice equal
to your character’s unarmed combat value if they
have one, or one die if they do not.

For each hit scored, the defending model is pushed
1 square directly away from the attacker. Armour
has no effect. The attacker can follow up to remain
adjacent to the defender if they wish, and have not
already moved their maximum distance this round.
None of these moves attract attacks of opportunity.

If you score 3 or more hits, the defending model is
then knocked prone.

If the square directly behind the defender is
blocked by other characters or terrain, they are
pushed in the closest possible direction instead. If
there is no space to push an opponent back, they
do not move.

, you have misjudged the attack
If you roll any
and stumble. The action is not resolved, and the
opposing model can immediately make a free
Knock Back action against you instead. If they also
roll a

, there is no effect.

Massive characters (marked with the  icon to
the right) use the number within the icon like
armour against Knock Backs, reducing the
number of hits. They also add this many automatic
hits to their own Knock Back attempts.

EXAMPLE

Hopper is blocking a doorway. Yeti wants to get
through the doorway to have access to an Ark
on the other side, and so he decides to knock
Hopper backwards.

Yeti does not have an unarmed combat value
so he rolls the standard 1 die for the attempt.
He scores a hit, allowing Hopper to be shoved
back 1 square, and leaving the doorway clear.

REPAIR
In Core Space, items and machines will often
become damaged and need to be repaired. This
can be as simple as a weapon that has been
broken in an assault, or a robotic Trader who has
taken some damage, or it could even be part of a
mission objective to repair a ship’s engine!

Repairing is an action that can only be taken by
Machine characters or those with the Tech Class.

All items that can be repaired will require a number
of Repair Points to be spent. For mission objectives
this will be detailed in the mission briefing, but
otherwise use the following:

•  Equipment Tokens: 1 Repair Point
•  Consoles: 3 Repair Points
•  Defeated Machine Characters: 5 Repair Points
(once Repaired, stand them up with 1 Health)
•  Damaged Machine Characters: 1 Repair Point

per Health Point

To make a Repair action your character must be
in contact with the thing that needs Repairing, and
not in contact with any enemies. For items, the
character must be holding them, or in contact with
the character that is.

Roll one combat die. Each hit will apply 1 Repair
Point. If this is not enough to fully repair the
equipment place a Reminder Counter next to the
item to track the Repair points. More actions can be
used to further Repair the equipment.

For damaged Machine characters, Repairing them
will add Health pegs so there is no need to track
this with counters.

Unless stated otherwise, a Machine character
cannot make a Repair action on itself.

RELOAD
Reloading can only be done if a character
is holding an ammo token and is not
engaged with an enemy.

When you reload, add the number of ammo
pegs listed on the token to your dashboard, up
to the maximum. You will usually have to then
flip (
to the supply.

) the token or discard (

) it and return it

INTERACT
Some missions will specify additional actions that
can be made. These will be specific to the mission
or terrain being used – pick a lock, defuse a bomb,
call an elevator, etc. Unless stated otherwise, to
Interact with an object a Trader must be in contact
with it and unengaged.

OTHER
There are a few other less common actions that
can be made by your crew, detailed below.

This list is not exhaustive – there may be other
actions that are used in specific missions, or only
when a character has a particular Skill. They will be
detailed in the appropriate place.

Once you’re familiar with the core rules, more
actions can be found in the Deluxe Rulebook, such
as Jumping and Climbing.

CLEAR JAM
This action unjams a ranged weapon, and can only
be done when not engaged with an enemy.

DON/REMOVE ARMOUR
Armour cannot be put straight into your character’s
armour slot – it takes time to put on. When picked
up it should be placed in the item tray. This action
is used to move or swap an armour token from the
tray to the armour slot or vice versa. This can only
be done when not engaged with an enemy.

STAND UP
This action allows a prone character to return to
their feet, standing the model upright. They act
normally from then on.

28

EFFORTLESS ACTIONS
Effortless actions are small things that a character
may do while on the run or in the heat of combat,
such as ducking out of the line of fire or swiping an
item from the floor as they run past.

Effortless actions are free – they do not count as
one of your actions for the turn and can therefore
be taken in addition to your regular actions.
However, you can only make one of these free
effortless actions per turn.

If you have already made an effortless action in
your turn, you can make more but they will count
towards your action limit instead. Alternatively, you
can spend a Skill peg to use a second effortless
action in a turn, but this will count as your Skill use
for that turn (see page 31).

Unless stated otherwise, effortless actions can only
be made before or after other actions – they cannot
be made mid-action.

Effortless actions include:

•  Making a Proximity Move
•  Using any item marked with the
•  Throwing an item
•  Picking up, dropping or swapping an item in an

 icon

adjacent square

•  Giving, taking or swapping an item with an

adjacent character (if the other player allows it)

Just like regular actions, there may be further
effortless actions available in certain missions or
with certain Skills. Some Skills may even make
regular actions effortless!

PROXIMITY MOVES
A Proximity Move represents a character ducking
into cover, sidestepping an attack, leaning around a
corner to shoot, or making the extra effort to charge
into combat.

It allows a character to move up to 1 square. This
follows all the regular movement rules.

EFFORTLESS ITEMS
Certain items will have the
to be used effortlessly. The item token will state the
effect that applies; for example:

 icon allowing them

•  Sensor Goggles that allow you

to Search effortlessly

•  A Combat Stim that gives you

2 extra actions this turn

•  A Medi-Stim that adds 2

Health pegs

Once the action is complete you will often have to
then discard (

) the token.

EXAMPLE

Cassie uses her first action of the
turn to Move into a room packed with
enemies where there is also a Combat
Knife on the floor. She moves into
contact with it and uses an effortless
action to pick it up.

As she still has Skill pegs available,
she uses one to take a second
effortless action to Throw the knife at
a nearby enemy, who takes damage
from the attack and is defeated.

Cassie then uses her second action to
Move out of the opposite doorway, out
of LoS of the First Born.

THROWING ITEMS
Items that can be thrown will have the following icon:

Note that this includes many close assault weapons
– launching a sword at someone may seem a bit
desperate but it can be effective! Throwing an item
requires LoS to the target, and most items can only
be thrown at short range. If an item can be thrown at a
longer distance there will be an M or l next to the icon.

Throwing a close assault weapon is resolved like a
ranged attack, using the number of dice inside the
icon. Cover, armour and any other modifiers apply
as normal. The thrown weapon is removed from
the character’s dashboard and placed on the floor
adjacent to the target. It can be picked up again
from the floor like any other token.

Note that thrown weapons can break just like any
 results. Place the token face
others following 2
down as a reminder.

BLAST WEAPONS
Blast weapons affect not only the target, but
also anyone in the surrounding squares.

They also do not have to target
a character – their attacks will be
resolved even if they hit a point on the
floor. They can even be aimed at such
a point if you wish, allowing the blast to
hit characters that would otherwise be
out of sight! These weapons are usually
thrown, such as grenades, but there
are other items and effects that use the
blast rules.

When firing or throwing a blast weapon,
first you need to determine the origin of the
blast. Choose a target square or character
within range and LoS as normal, and then
roll the blue combat die as follows:

•  Any number of hits: You have hit your target.
•  Blank/No hits: You have missed – the origin of the blast is one square away from your target in a

direction of your choice (including diagonally).

•

: You have seriously missed – the origin of the blast is up to two squares away from your target

in a direction of the target player’s choice (or the first player if the target was an NPC).

If there is intervening terrain between the shooter and the target, reduce the number of hits rolled by 1.

Number of combat dice/
effect used on target
character (if any).

Number of combat dice used on any character
in the eight squares adjacent to the target point.

Number of combat dice used on any character
in the 16 squares two squares away from the
target point or character.

Once the origin of the blast has been determined, roll combat dice for every character hit by the blast as
shown in the diagram.

 results are ignored when rolling for the effects of a blast. Blast effects cannot pass through walls.

They will however pass through windows and across other short terrain pieces. Characters on the
other side of the terrain hit by the blast will benefit from a cover modifier as usual.

Note: If measuring and using inches, blast effects will hit characters at least partially within one and two
inches of the target rather than the two surrounding sets of squares.

30

use will be detailed in its description. This trigger
condition, or any action currently being taken (for
example an opponent making an attack) must be
fully resolved before your Skill is used. The Skill
must then be used immediately, before regular play
resumes where it left off.

Reaction Skills can be used even if your character
has already been activated this round.

DUPLICATE SKILLS
Some characters may have a
Skill type on their profile as a
base ability, and then have the
same Skill type on their Class
Board, or granted by an item.
When determining what level of that Skill can be
used, these are added together.

For example, Cassie has Weapons Expert Level 2
as a base ability and can also learn further levels of
the Skill on the Marine Class Board. If one of these
levels was marked, she would be able to add it to
the two from her base ability and use the Skill at
level 3.

Note that sometimes these Skills might be in the
character’s armour slot. Therefore, putting armour
on may reduce the level of a certain Skill available
to a character, even if they also had it on their
Class Board.

All Skills have a maximum level of 3.

USING SKILLS
Skills are specialised abilities that allow characters
to do things over and above the standard rules.

Each character has their own skill set comprising of
the Skills on their Class Board and often one or two
on their Trader Board. Each Skill is represented
by a coloured icon – a full list of these Skills can
be found on page 93. The spaces around each
Skill icon will be marked to show the character’s
proficiency with that Skill, from Level 1 to Level 3.

Once per round, Traders can spend Skill pegs to
use one of their Skills. Some Skills are used during
other actions, and other Skills will grant actions
themselves – these are done before or after regular
actions, but not during, and do not count as one of
your actions for the turn.

To use a Skill, they must:

1.  Select which Skill they want to use and at

which level.

2.  Remove a number of Skill pegs from their
dashboard equal to the Skill’s level. For
example, using a level 2 Skill removes 2 pegs.
3.  Carry out the action listed in the Skill section

for that Skill.

Unless otherwise noted in the Skill’s description,
Skills must be used during a character’s turn.

If a Skill contradicts anything in the core rules, the
Skill’s description takes precedence.

Remember that Skill pegs can also be spent on
effortless actions. This counts towards the once
per round limit, and you will not be able to use any
other Skills until the following round.

PASSIVE SKILLS
Some Skills have rules
marked as passive.
Once a character has
the relevant level of that
Skill or above, this rule is
always in effect, and does
not require any Skill pegs to
use. Passive Skills can still be
used if a character has no Skill
pegs remaining.

REACTIONS
Some Skills are marked as
reactions. These will usually be
used outside of your character’s
turn, reacting to an event or attack
made by another character. The

EXAMPLE – SKILLS

Wade has picked the Hunter Class and has the Fade to
Black Skill. Let’s assume he has spent some of his Career
points on it and can use it up to level 2.

Wade is in the open and is fired at by a Drone in the First
Born Phase. He only has 2 Health pegs left so the player is
worried. The Fade to Black Skill allows the Trader to react
and duck into cover when attacked, which could save his
life in this situation.

Once the Drone’s target is established, Wade spends one of
his Skill pegs to Move behind a nearby crate. He is now in
cover and can ignore one of the Drone’s hits, if it scores any.

To ensure his safety, the player could instead have used
two Skill pegs to use the level 2 version of the Skill –
Moving, and then ignoring all hits.

DEFEATED CHARACTERS
A defeated Trader is not necessarily dead – they
may be unconscious or just too injured to move.
Whatever the reason, they are incapacitated
and cannot participate in the mission. A defeated
Trader miniature should be laid on its side, and an
Assistance Counter placed next to them to remind
you that they are not just prone.

Hope is not lost however. The other Traders (from
any crew) on the board may attempt to help.

Important: Unless stated otherwise, defeated
Traders can never be targeted by an enemy or
selected when a rule calls for a random Trader.

REVIVING CHARACTERS
Items or Skills that restore Health such as a
Medi-Stim or Medi-Pack can be used to revive
a defeated Trader. However, they must be used
by another Trader in base contact – the defeated
Trader cannot use items themselves. The Trader
using the item can take it from their own supplies,
or from the defeated Trader’s item tray.

A revived Trader restores the specified amount of
Health and removes the Assistance Counter. They
are left prone, but can activate as normal in the
current round, if they haven’t already.

GRAB A LEG
If the crew don’t have any medical supplies,
defeated characters can also be carried or dragged
back to their ships.

As long as the defeated character is not in contact
with an enemy, a Trader in contact with a defeated
character can spend an action to Move up to 2
squares, taking the defeated character with them.

If another Trader from your
crew is in contact with the
defeated character, you
may Move both Traders
and the defeated character
up to 4 squares instead
as a single action. Both
are still bound by the
11-square maximum.
Place a Reminder Counter
next to the other character
that moved – they will take
one fewer action in their
next turn.

ROB THEM BLIND
More ruthless players may opt to ‘rescue’ the
defeated character’s equipment rather than the
character themselves. Other Traders in contact
with the defeated Trader can make a Search
action as if the Trader were a Searchable terrain
piece – taking any items they want from the
character’s item tray. Any discarded items are left
next to the defeated Trader.

END OF A MISSION
In a campaign, characters left defeated at the end
of a mission must be extracted – see page 58. If
any of their equipment was stolen during the game,
they will not get it back.

32

FIRST BORN PHASE
In the First Born Phase, more First Born may
arrive onto the board and attack. In each round
the First Born are moved and rolled for by the first
player, unless that player’s crew are the ones being
attacked, in which case another player should roll.

The Phase has two stages:

1.  Arrival
2.  Activation

ARRIVAL
Each Hostility level includes a number of icons
indicating the characters that could potentially
arrive in this phase.

Drone

Liege

Iconoclast

True Born

Cerberosa

Talos

If an icon is followed by a number, that many First
Born will arrive. If the icon is followed by a die icon,
roll that die to determine whether any First Born will
appear. Start at the top, and work down the list to
see what arrives.

EXAMPLE

First Born Die – one
character arrives per
 result.

Knowledge Die – a
True Born arrives on
a 6.

When the Hostility level reaches Cleanse, the
number of First Born arriving will be the same as in
Threat Defence, but remember that from now on all
First Born characters will use the increased statistics
on the reverse side of the First Born Board.

The First Born will arrive at a
random location around the board
determined by the Knowledge Die.
The numbers on the die correspond
to the Entry Point counters. Roll
separately for each type of First
Born arriving.

Once you have determined the number of First Born
arriving and their respective Entry Points, place
them on the board adjacent to their Entry Point. If
there is no room because the area is blocked by
other models, place them as close as possible.

Note that sometimes First Born will be placed next
to Entry Points outside of the First Born Phase (by
an Event Card for example). In this case they will
be placed onto the board at that Entry Point and
then activate in the First Born Phase as normal.

For example, in Aware, the following First
Born will arrive:

Firstly, 2 Drones are placed. The
Knowledge Die rolls a 3, so they are
placed onto the board on/next to Patrol
Point 3 (see overleaf for more about
Patrol Points).

A single Liege is then placed, again
according to the Knowledge Die – a 5 this
time placing it adjacent to Entry Point 5.

Next, the First Born Die is rolled to
determine the number of Iconoclasts,
along with the Knowledge Die to show
their location. The First Born Die rolls a

 and the Knowledge Die rolls a 5. The
Liege we placed earlier is in front of Entry
Point 5, so the Iconoclast is placed in one
of the other adjacent spaces.

Finally we need to roll for a True Born, but this uses the Knowledge Die instead
of the First Born Die so there is only a 1 in 6 chance of it turning up. The die
rolls a

 so the Traders are safe, for now!

ACTIVATION
All First Born on the board will now activate. The
highest ranked character on the board will activate
first, followed by the next highest rank, and so
on down to the rank 1 Drones acting last of all. If
there is more than one of the same rank on the
board, the first player chooses the order in which
they activate.

In the Trader Phase,
you were able to decide
which actions your crew
would take. However, the
NPCs in the game are not
under your control. They
will instead take actions
based on the following
strict AI sequence. Each
First Born character will
continue to take actions
from this list until they
have none left to use.

TARGETS
Before making their activation, each First Born
character will choose a target!

•

•

•  By default the target will be the closest non-First
Born character within LoS and not in cover.
If all visible characters are in cover, the target
will be the closest.
If there are no visible characters, their target will
instead be the closest non-First Born character.
Work this out by measuring the shortest
possible distance between the First Born and
the potential targets, moving around terrain and
through doors as necessary.

•  Defeated Traders are never targeted.

Once a target has been chosen, it remains locked
for the rest of that character’s turn unless it is
defeated. This applies even if a closer target came
into view part-way through a move. The target is
only reassessed mid-turn if the original target is
defeated. Otherwise it will be reassessed next time
that character activates.

DRONE ARRIVAL
Drones work a little differently to other First Born
characters. In the Arrival stage Drones will emerge
from their alcoves, arriving on top of
Patrol Points rather than adjacent to
Entry Points. Patrol Points will be
placed in rooms and corridors around
the board rather than at the edges
but otherwise work in the same way.
Furthermore, in the Patrol hostility level
Drones only arrive in the rounds marked
on the tracker rather than arriving every round.

Note: Don’t forget that one Drone will start the
mission in play as detailed on page 16, and it will
activate in the first round even if no other Drones
arrive on the board.

NOT ENOUGH FIRST BORN?
In a game with no more than three crews you will
only use the First Born miniatures that come in the
core set – 5 Drones, 3 Lieges and 2 Iconoclasts. At
times you may find that you need to roll for a type
of First Born to enter the board, but there are none
of that type left.

If this is the case, use the next lowest ranked
First Born character available. For example, if an
Iconoclast (rank 3) is required but unavailable use
a Liege (rank 2) instead; if a Liege is unavailable
use a Drone (rank 1).

If there are no Drones left and you need to
spawn more, then none will arrive until some
have been defeated.

FIRE AND POISON
First Born are immune to the effects
of Fire and Poison, although they
still suffer damage and any other
effects of attacks that use them.
There are no weapons with Fire
or Poison rules in this starter set
but they can be found in other
Core Space expansions.

34

ACTIONS
The First Born can make Move and Assault actions
and will use them in the same way as Traders.

First Born that have been knocked prone must use
their first action to Stand Up, before making the rest
of their activation as normal.

Otherwise, each time they make an action, the First
Born will prioritise the action that causes the most
harm possible, using the AI Action Chart below.

Once you’ve played a couple of times, these actions
will become second nature. A few things to remember:

•  First Born that take a Move action always move
as far as possible (i.e. the full 4 squares) unless
they move adjacent to the target at which point
they will stop.

•  Ranged Assault actions taken by the First
Born can be made at up to medium range
and follow the normal rules for shooting at
engaged characters.

•  First Born are unaffected by

 results unless

•

•

stated otherwise.
If First Born cannot reach their target without
entering an area that would cause them harm
(within 2 squares of an active Exhaust or Rock
Worm for example) they will instead spend one
action phasing to the Entry Point closest to and
with an open route to their target. They will then
continue to act as normal. If there is no safe
route they will take the harmful one.
If for any reason a First Born character other
than a Drone is in play during the Patrol Hostility
level, when activated it will scatter once instead
of making its actions. It will act normally from
Inspection onwards. It will be alerted by enemies
in the same way as a Drone (see overleaf).

DRONE ACTIVATION
Drones activate differently to their bipedal masters.

DRONE AI CHART

Is the Drone
in base contact
with an enemy?

YES

Move the
Drone away from
the enemy, moving
as far as possible
while still allowing
the best chance of
a successful attack
against that enemy.

NO

Is there a target
within LoS and
medium range?

YES

Will moving
increase
the chance of
successful attack
(e.g. avoiding
cover)

YES

Make the
smallest Move
action possible
that increases the
chance of success

Use all remaining
actions to make
Ranged Assault actions
against the target.

NO

Move
towards
the nearest
enemy.

Is there a target
within LoS and
medium range?

NO

YES

NO

Move
towards the
nearest enemy.

During the Patrol Hostility level Drones activate
as follows, starting with the Drone at the lowest
numbered Patrol Point and working upwards:

•  Scan their current area (see below).
•  Move to the next Patrol Point. Remove the

Drone from the board and place it at the Patrol
Point with the next highest number, e.g. 1 to 2,
4 to 5, or from 6 back to 1. If the Patrol Point is
occupied, place it as close as possible.

•  Scan their new area.

To perform a scan, check if there are any enemies
within LoS and medium range. If so, the Drones
become alerted (see below).

During the Inspection Hostility level and beyond
Drones will activate using their own unique AI
Chart. Like the standard AI chart, these actions are
intuitive and will become second nature after a few
rounds. If Drones are unable to reach their target
without harm, instead of phasing to an Entry Point
they will Move towards the nearest Patrol Point and
then spend an action to place themselves at the
Patrol Point nearest their target.

In addition, Drones never intentionally move
adjacent to enemies. If a drone would enter a
square adjacent to an enemy during a Move action
it will stop one square away.

ALERTING THE DRONES

Alerting the Drones instantly moves the Hostility
level to Inspection – add pegs to the tracker until
the first hole of the Inspection level is filled.

If Drones become alerted in the First Born Phase,
all Drones can immediately take their actions even
if they moved Patrol Point in that round.

Drones can also be alerted outside the First Born
Phase by the following events:

•  A Ranged Assault action that
 icon is
does not have the
made anywhere on the board.
•  A grenade, mine or similar weapon

that does not have the
set off anywhere on the board.

•  A drone suffers an attack of

any kind.

•  An enemy moves adjacent to

a Drone.

KNOWLEDGE DIE
The First Born have formidable knowledge
and power beyond that of any being
encountered before and will attack in
unpredictable ways. This is represented
by the purple Knowledge Die.

Most First Born use this die when they attack,
represented by the following icon next to the attack
statistic on their board:

FEAR

The First Born are physically imposing but their true
power is in their ability to manipulate minds.

Fear Counters will be generated by
the Knowledge Die and by other
game effects and will be used to
mark characters affected by Fear.
Characters can have any number of
Fear Counters.

When character marked with a Fear Counter
activates, they will not perform their actions as
normal. Instead, all of their actions must be spent
Moving as far away as possible from any enemies,
provoking attacks of opportunity if engaged. They
will not engage enemies during this Move, but
will run through other hazards such as active
Exhaust Vents, sustaining the effects as normal. If
surrounded, the character may stand still or move
just a short distance and do nothing further. If there
are no enemies in play, they will instead Move
towards their airlock, or the nearest entry point in
the case of NPCs.

Once these actions have been completed, the
character’s turn is over and one Fear Counter
is removed.

Traders may spend a Skill peg when they activate
to remove a Fear Counter and take their turn as
normal if no Fear Counters remain.

Captains are battle-hardened and can calm their
comrades. A Captain may spend an action to
remove a Fear Counter from themselves or another
member of their crew within short range and LoS.

Purge (including Rogue Purge) and Traders with
the Machine class never suffer Fear Counters.

The first time that these characters make an
attack in each round, roll the Knowledge Die
alongside the Combat Dice and apply the
additional effects listed below.

Extra Action: The character gains an
additional action this turn.

Terrify: The target character is marked
with a Fear Counter.

Warp: After the attack the target is moved
three squares in the direction shown on
the die and knocked prone. If they hit a
wall they stop and suffer damage equal to
the roll of one die, ignoring armour. Any
abilities that allow immediate retaliation
cannot be used.

Consume: Damage from this attack will
remove Skill pegs instead of Health pegs
if any Skill pegs are available. Otherwise
remove Health pegs as normal.

Focused Assault: If this is a Ranged Assault
it ignores cover. If this is a Close Assault it
scatters a random equipment token from
the target’s equipment tray in addition to any
damage caused. NPCs or targets with no
equipment are knocked prone instead.

Phase: After the attack, remove the
character from the board. Place them back
onto the board two squares away from
the next nearest enemy character other
than their original target. They will target
this new character for the rest of their
activation. If there are no other enemy
characters, there is no effect.

When using the Cleanse side of the First Born
board the Knowledge Die icon has a '2' in it – this
means it is used the first two times that character
attacks in each round.

THE TRUE BORN
The True Born is the most powerful of its kind and
is kept in almost permanent stasis, attended to
regularly by its Lieges.

Unlike other First Born its double-sided character
board does not flip when the Hostility reaches
Cleanse. Instead the two sides represent
the True Born in different states – one in its
somnambulant fugue state and another for when
it has been fully awoken.

STATISTICS AND DAMAGE
The True Born comes with four sets of statistics
that can be swapped in and out of its Board,
numbered 1-4. When placed onto the gaming area
it uses the insert marked 1.

When the True Born first arrives it
will be inside its Stasis Chamber
– place the terrain piece adjacent
to the Patrol Point. The True Born
will not activate until it emerges
from the Chamber.

Once the Hostility reaches Wake
Protocols the True Born will
emerge in its Somnambulant
state – place the miniature
adjacent to the Chamber. It will
activate each round from this
point onwards. If the True Born
arrives in Wake Protocols or
later it will emerge immediately
on arrival.

ACTIVATION
The Somnambulant True
Born is only sleepwalking,
and its activation consists of
scattering it twice. It will make
no other actions.

Once the True Born is awake (see below) it will
activate following the AI chart as normal.

Note: A Somnambulant True Born will never make
attacks of opportunity.

WAKING UP
Once a True Born is in play and active its
attendants will attempt to wake it up and unleash its
full power on the intruders.

In each First Born Phase, the closest Liege to
the True Born must be activated before any
other Lieges, and when it does it will not follow
the normal rules. Instead it must spend all of its
actions moving towards the True Born (provoking
attacks of opportunity if appropriate). Once it
enters contact with the True Born it must spend
its next action waking the True Born up. Note that
if a Liege spends its last action in a round moving
into contact, the True Born will have moved away
before it can be awoken.

Once awoken, flip the
True Born’s character
board to the Awake
side, with its number 1
health insert in place
(regardless of any
damage taken while
Somnambulant). Swap
the miniature for the
awake version.

Unlike other NPCs, when the True Born takes
damage it is not instantly defeated. Instead, for
each point of damage it suffers its insert is removed
and replaced with the next; first 2, then 3, and then
4. Otherwise, it can continue to act normally. Only
when a True Born’s fourth insert is removed is the
character defeated and removed from the table.

ARRIVAL
There is only one True Born in any given location,
and as such a True Born will only appear once
per game. Once one has been placed, do not roll
it again for the rest of the game, and any other
rule that would generate one is ignored. Event
Cards that would place a second one due to being
unresolved are not shuffled back in. Once the True
Born has been defeated, it will not return.

Like Drones, the True Born emerges from its stasis
inside the rock at a Patrol Point, not an Entry Point.

38

DEFEATING THE TRUE BORN
If the True Born is defeated (in either state), the
resulting psychic wave affects all remaining First
Born. Mark all Lieges and Iconoclasts in play with
a Reminder Counter. They miss their next turn. In
addition, flip the First Born Board (if not already
flipped), and use the ‘Cleanse’ statistics for the rest
of the game.

If the True Born is defeated while in its Awake state
any equipment it is carrying is dropped where it fell.

FORCED AWAKENING
If left out of stasis for too long nerve and brain
damage will occur. Some suffer from mania when
first awoken, others long term paranoia.

If the Hostility reaches Cleanse and the True Born
is still in its Somnambulant state, flip its board
immediately, with its number 2 insert in place
(regardless of any damage already taken). Place
a Fear Counter on its board to remind you that its
awakening was forced.

For the rest of the game, its target will always be
the closest character, friend or foe.

Then, take two True Born equipment
tokens at random – one small and
one large. Place these into the slots
in the True Born character board.
The True Born will not use these
items, but they can be claimed by the
Traders if it is defeated.

One of the key tactical decisions in Core Space: First
Born is when and where to take down the Lieges to
prevent (or even allow) the True Born’s awakening!

ATTACKING THE TRUE BORN
In its somnambulant stage a True Born is in a fugue
state, only partially conscious. It is protected by a mantle
draped around its neck that can defend against intruders
on its behalf and can even warp its immediate reality.

If a Somnambulant True Born would take any
amount of damage (after beating or bypassing its
shield value), this shroud will activate. Do not apply
any damage. Instead, roll the Knowledge Die and
apply the result:

1.  Reality Shift

The True Born was never really there. Scatter it
twice, ignoring all terrain, including walls.

2.  Matter Mirror

Your attack is reflected back at you. Resolve
the attack against the character that made it.

3.  Kinetic Absorber
No further effect.
4.  Instinctive Reflexes

The mantle’s Impact Shield deflects the attack,
but the True Born is shaken enough to lunge
at its attackers. The True Born makes up to 2
Move actions towards the nearest character
(friend or foe). If it engages or is already
engaged with an enemy it will make a Close
Assault attack. If it survives, the target will be
pushed back one square and knocked prone.

5.  Scryer Overload

The True Born sustains 1 damage. Its defences
are overloaded and its shroud tries to predict and
shift immediate futures. The resulting reality wave
knocks all other characters in short range prone.
For each Trader affected, the owning player
may view one Event Card, placing any cards
viewed back on the deck in the same order.

6.  Reboot

The True Born sustains 2 damage. Unable to
defend its wearer the shroud shuffles through
realities to find some alternative protectors. If
the True Born survives the attack, take the three
lowest-ranking First Born characters from those
not in use (if available) and place them in contact
with the True Born. They will activate as normal
from the next First Born Phase.

Once the True Born is awake it is attacked as normal.

NPC PHASE
In this Phase, all other NPCs controlled by the
game will act. Core Space: First Born has one type
of NPC that will act in this phase – Game Hunters –
but other Core Space sets will introduce others.

The reverse side of your Trader boards shows
them as Civilians. While there are no Civilians
wandering the halls of the First Born asteroids,
this gives you the option of integrating the new
characters back into other Core Space missions
that do use Civilians.

•  NPCs can fire at up to medium range,

and follow the normal rules for shooting at
engaged characters.
•  NPCs are unaffected by

 results unless

stated otherwise.

•  NPCs will not enter an area that would cause
them harm (within 2 squares of an active
Exhaust or Rock Worm for example) unless
there is no other route to their target.

JOINING CREWS
It is possible for some NPCs to join your crew,
usually when Persuaded by a Trader.

For your first few games you can choose not to use
NPCs at all while you learn the rest of the rules.

Once an NPC has joined a Trader crew, they are
part of that crew for all purposes.

Like the First Born, NPCs are controlled by the
game, but should be physically moved and rolled for
by the first player unless that player’s crew is being
attacked in which case another player should roll.

ORDER OF ACTIVATION
NPCs are ranked like the First Born. This is shown
on their Boards.

For each type of NPC activated, the highest ranked
one on the board will activate first, followed by the
next highest rank, and so on.

If there are multiple NPCs of the same type and
rank on the board, the first player can choose the
order in which they activate.

TARGETS
Each NPC type has a target priority list. When
required, NPCs choose their targets in the same
way as the First Born (see page 34), except that
for each bullet point they will choose the highest
priority target from their list. For example, if a Game
Hunter had a First Born and a Ganger in LoS and
not in cover, it would target the First Born.

ACTIONS
NPCs will take the actions described in their rules,
remembering the following:

•  NPCs that have been knocked prone must use
their first action to Stand Up, before taking any
further actions as normal.

•  NPCs that take a Move action always move as
far as possible (i.e. the full 4 squares) unless
they move into base contact with their target, at
which point they will stop.

They will be activated in the Trader Phase by that
crew’s player and can make all available actions as
normal. They will retain their normal statistics for now
– do not flip their Character Board. If defeated, they
are removed from the board and cannot be revived.

CARRYING ITEMS
When an NPC joins a crew, you will have the use
of their item slot, for small tokens only. If they were
not already carrying an item, draw one at random
from the supply and place it in their item slot. The
NPC cannot use any items themselves, but Traders
can swap items with them. NPCs can also Search
for you during a game.

If an NPC leaves your crew, any item they are
carrying remains in their Character Board. You can
still try to Persuade them to trade it or attack them
and take it by force as normal.

If an NPC is defeated, any item they were carrying
is left on the floor where they fell.

PERMANENT HIRES
In a campaign, NPCs that are still part of your
crew and get back to your ship at the end of a
mission can be permanently hired – see page 62
for more details.

They are still considered part of your crew even when
they are the only Traders left on the board, so if you
wanted to keep them you would continue playing until
they escaped or were defeated as normal. If you do
not want to hire them permanently you can end the
game prematurely, leaving them to their fate…

40

ROCK WORMS
Having escaped from the First Born laboratories,
these enormous Worms excrete plasma to bore
their way through the rock on the hunt for prey.

In the game, these worms are NPCs that emerge
from their tunnels to attack anything and everything
in their path! Although their tough hide is not
impenetrable, they can block escape routes and
waste valuable time for your Traders.

A reminder of the
statistics and rules
for Rock Worms can
be found on their
Reference Card.

Any mission featuring
Rock Worms will
use the Event cards
marked with the
icon, and you can
add Rock Worms to
your own missions by
shuffling these cards
into the deck.

ARRIVAL
Rock Worms will arrive when
specified by Event Cards, and
will emerge from a random hole
located around the board. When
they arrive, the worm hole marker
is flipped over so the hole is visible.

Any character standing in one of the four
squares on top of the worm hole when it arrives
is swallowed whole and removed from the
game. Scatter up to two random items from their
equipment tray. All other equipment is lost. Traders
killed in this way are permanently dead – they can
no longer be used in a campaign.

The Worm will then instantly attack the nearest
character (see below).

Rock Worms do not move around the board – they
will remain on their worm hole until defeated or
removed by an Event Card or other effect.

ACTIVATION
Rock Worms have lightning-quick reflexes. Instead
of making a single activation in the NPC Phase,
Rock Worms instantly react to anything that comes
close, interrupting the turns of other characters.

They can reach anything within two squares of their
worm hole that is not blocked by a wall.

Any character of any type that enters this area
(intentionally or otherwise) suffers an immediate
close assault attack. This interrupts their
movement, and they can continue moving after the
attack if they survive. Worms will also attack when
any other action is made while within this area,
resolved after the action is complete. This even
applies if a character wastes an action by doing
nothing, or if the character’s action resulted in the
worm’s defeat – its death throes are violent!

ADDITIONAL RULES
The First Born are well aware of the worms’
presence. Rock Worms will not alert Drones.

Rock Worms cannot be knocked prone.

Rock Worms never suffer Fire or Poison Tokens
(available in other expansions), but will still suffer
any other effects of a weapon that uses them.

WORM HOLE PLACEMENT
Worm hole markers begin the game with the hole
face down so they look like open ground. They
represent the potential places a worm could arrive.

The missions in this book specify the placement
of the worm holes on the mission map. However,
if you want to add the worms to a different mission
you must place the holes randomly at the start of
the mission.

Place the first worm hole marker as close to the
centre of the board as possible. Then for each
subsequent marker roll to scatter twice from the
location of the previous one. Place the new marker
as close to this position as possible, ensuring its
area of attack does not overlap that of another hole
and it is not within two squares of an Entry Point,
Patrol Point or airlock door.

GAME HUNTERS
Even the apex predator Rock Worms aren’t at the top
of the food chain. If there’s money to be made, there
are people who will exploit anything and everything.

If there are multiple routes towards the nearest
Beast or worm hole, they will take the least-
threatened route, i.e. with the fewest, weakest
enemies. If there is no difference, they will take the
shortest route.

DEFEATING BEASTS
If a Beast is defeated while one or more
Game Hunters is in play, drop a Trophy
token where it fell. This represents the body
part the Hunters want to extract and sell.

Game Hunters will move towards Trophy tokens as
if they were living Beasts, but instead of attacking
they will Move adjacent to the token and spend
their next action collecting it – place it in their item
slot. If it does not fit, discard non-Trophy items to
make room.

Once all available Trophy tokens have been
collected, or all surviving Game Hunters are
carrying a Trophy, the Game Hunters will
leave, even if Beasts still remain on the board.
Instead of activating as normal,
they will spend their actions
Moving towards the nearest
Entry Point. If they reach it
they are removed from play.

Note: Other characters cannot pick
up Trophy tokens from fallen Beasts –
they do not know what part of the Beast
has value or how to extract it. Other
characters can however take Trophy
tokens once they have been picked up
by a Game Hunter.

TARGET PRIORITY LIST

1.  First Born
2.  Gangers
3.  Traders (only if provoked)
4.  Beasts

Game Hunters are Traders, but with a very
particular set of skills. They specialise in hunting

type that includes Rock
Worms, and extracting
teeth, bones, glands or
anything else with black market value.

attack against Beasts.
If there are no Beasts in play: They will spend
their actions Moving towards the nearest worm
hole marker (or entry point if Worms are not
being used). Once they reach an adjacent
square they will continue moving towards the

Note: If multiple Game Hunters are in play, they
will stick together while patrolling. When a Game
Hunter first reaches a worm hole, they will not
continue their movement to the next (spending their
actions doing nothing) until all other Game Hunters
in play are within short range and heading towards
the same worm hole. They will still Move when
targeting Beasts or other enemies as normal.

If a Game Hunter Moves within short range and
LoS of an enemy while en-route to a Beast or worm
hole, they will stop and use any remaining actions
to attack that enemy.

Many are from privileged
backgrounds and are often bored rich kids looking for glory and fame. Others are in pursuit of riches,
selling rare, alien skins to the highest bidder. A smaller subset are drawn solely to the thrill of danger, or
the challenge of downing a cunning prey.

In many ways Game Hunters are an anachronism, putting themselves deliberately in danger when
easier alternatives are available. The hunt is what matters, the pitting of the hunter against the hunted;
they are the ultimate thrill seekers where the final outcome is personal pride or bragging rights.

Well-equipped and well trained, the Game Hunters are the antithesis of Traders who would sooner
sell their expensive equipment and keep away from danger! Hunters will often commission Traders
to escort them into danger zones and distract the less valuable ‘prey’ while they go for the big prize.
Although Traders have little respect for Hunters, they do pay well. It has even been known for Traders to
commission Hunters when well-armed point men are needed in unexplored areas. True to their nature
Big Game Hunters will only agree if the mission intrigues them enough!

ADDITIONAL RULES
If a Game Hunter is
attacked and survives,
they instantly attack back
against their attacker.

•

Otherwise,

If engaged with their
attacker, they will make
a Close Assault action.
•
unless already
engaged with
another hostile
character they will
make a Ranged
Assault action.
If engaged with
another enemy,
they will do
nothing.

Game Hunters
only consider
Traders to be
enemies if a
member of that
Trader’s crew
has attacked
a Game Hunter
in the current
mission, or has
attempted to steal
Caaligorn’s Rifle.

Game Hunters cannot be Persuaded while a Beast
or Trophy is in play. If a Hunter has already been
Persuaded to join a crew and then a Beast enters play,
the Hunter will immediately leave the crew and act as
an NPC again.

CAALIGORN’S HUNT RIFLE

The Game Hunter Caaligorn
carries a powerful and uniquely
calibrated game rifle fitted with
a dead-man’s switch. Only a
highly skilled character can retrieve this weapon
from its owner.

This weapon can only be obtained by using the
Disarm, Light Fingers, or Hack and Grab (Level 2,
2 Hits only) Skills against Caaligorn. It can be taken
instead of anything in his item slot, taking the token
directly from the supply.

If his rifle is taken, mark him with a Reminder Counter
– Caaligorn can no longer make ranged attacks.

If Caaligorn is defeated without retrieving his weapon
first the weapon is not dropped and is considered to
be destroyed.

Once a Trader has obtained this weapon, it can be
used as normal, but it can only be taken from the
Trader using the same Skills as against Caaligorn.
If the Trader is killed, or the weapon is taken from
the Trader in any other way, it is destroyed.

MISSIONS
As described on page 16, each game of Core
Space is a mission – a narrative scenario with a
series of objectives. When using the campaign
rules on page 54, missions can be played one
after the other with your crew’s performance in one
game affecting the next. Alternatively, each mission
can be played as a one-off.

Either way, before you start you will need to select
a crew – see page 50.

MISSION STRUCTURE
Each mission will be presented as a mission
briefing and each will follow the same format with
the following sections:

INTRODUCTION
Each mission will have a title and a narrative
introduction. This will set the scene, explaining why
your crews are here, what they are looking for, and
the dangers that may lie ahead.

OBJECTIVES
All missions will have a Primary Objective and
some may also have Secondary Objectives.
Completing these will determine how successful
you have been at the end of the mission.

Primary Objectives are the main purpose of the
mission, and they will often have a large cash
reward as well. This cash will be critical for
maintaining your ship and purchasing equipment.

Secondary Objectives are lucrative side-jobs that
you can complete while in the area – taking out a
Game Hunter to claim a bounty on their head, or
destroying a Dyson Reactor to disrupt a First Born
counterattack for example. These will usually have
a smaller reward or benefit in the campaign.

Note that unless stated otherwise, objectives do
not have to be completed to finish a game. What’s
important is that your crew lives to fight another
day. It’s perfectly reasonable to decide to cut your
losses and escape – it might put you in a better
position in the long run!

OBJECTIVE TOKENS

If your objectives involve finding
items specific to your narrative,
rather than weapons or other existing
equipment, the game includes
objective tokens for this purpose that
can be carried as normal.

Objective tokens cannot be broken or destroyed.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
This section will list any rules that apply to the
game over and above the core mechanics.
For example, it may list alternative deployment
locations, specific equipment to place in the Arks
as your objective, or an NPC that doesn’t follow the
normal rules.

This section will also list any specific terrain
that can be Interacted with, such as a computer
console you need to access or some machinery
you need to Repair.

MAP
Each mission will have a diagram showing how to
set up the mission map, detailing the location of
rooms, corridors, and other scenery. The Special
Instructions section will often refer to highlighted
areas on the map to indicate objectives or other
key locations.

Each map will follow the key on the next page.

Note that unless stated otherwise, the edge of
the playing area is considered to be a wall for all
rules purposes.

44

SET UP DIAGRAM
Finally, each mission will have a set up diagram
with the following sections. These will be used when
setting up the mission as detailed on page 16.

The First Born Support cards are to be used when
you want to make your game more dangerous by
adding a second set of First Born miniatures, so
you’ll have 9 Drones, 6 Lieges, and 4 Iconoclasts!

If there are 4 or more crews in play, it is
recommended to always use the extra set of
miniatures and the First Born Support cards.

Key Items: These are items that should be put
aside before the terrain pieces are filled – they will
usually be required for specific objectives.

Search Allocation: This section will show how to
allocate equipment tokens to the terrain pieces for
this mission.

Starting Hostility: This will tell you how many
pegs to put into the Hostility Tracker before the
game begins. Some missions are set in especially
hostile environments, or with the First Born already
awoken, so the game may start at a higher level.

Maximum Starting Crew: Crews can contain up to
seven Traders, but you won’t always be able to use
all of them in every mission. The maximum number
of Traders you can have on the board at once is
listed here.

Event Cards: You won’t use all Event Cards in all
games. Depending on the location of the mission,
the NPCs being used, and the length of the game,
you will only use a certain subset of the cards.
Use the icons in the bottom corners of the cards to
check against the card types listed here, and once
you have them all shuffle them together to create
the deck for the game. The icons are as follows:

•  Environment

•  First Born

•  Assistance

•  Game Hunters

•  Rock Worms

•  First Born Support

CHOOSING A MISSION
Now you know how missions work, you’ll need
to know which one to play! For new players, we
recommend starting with the First Born Campaign
on page 65. This is a narrative campaign with
pre-generated missions. It is for a single crew
either used solo or split between two players
playing co-operatively.

You can play the missions individually or you
can join them together as one continuous story
following the rules on page 54.

Once you’ve completed the campaign, you can find
more missions in other Core Space Starter Sets
and Expansions, and there are even more missions
posted for free on the Battle Systems website.

If you’re not ready for a full campaign just yet, or
if you’ve got a couple more players, you can get
started with the standard 1-4 player Exploration
mission on page 48.

Of course, Core Space has one foot in the creative
world of RPGs, and has everything you need to
design your own missions and tell your own stories.
A complete set of guidelines for doing this can be
found in the Deluxe Rulebook.

REPLAYING MISSIONS
Mission objectives do not need to be completed for
a mission to end. As detailed on page 18, all that’s
important is that you get out alive.

Especially when playing a campaign, if you finish
a mission without achieving the objective you may
wish to replay it and try again, so that you can
continue the story. If so, we recommend that you
make a few tweaks to the mission as detailed on
page 18 to represent the area being a little different
during your next visit! It’s generally worth making
the game a little harder, as even if you failed the
first time you will still have gained some experience
and salvaged some equipment so you’ll be in a
better position to try again.

RESCUE MISSIONS
Sometimes, part of your crew will manage to get back to your ship but one or more of your Traders
will have been left behind. In a campaign you will probably want to do something about this! There are
plenty of options available to you in the Extraction Phase (see page 58), one of which is to perform a
Rescue Mission.

This allows you to go straight back into the game you just played and save your fallen comrade. You
reload your guns, patch your wounds and hit yourself with the best combat stims money can buy.

Immediately start a new game with the following rules:

•  The board and all non-Trader components remain in place from the end of the original game,
including the First Born and any other NPCs in play. The Hostility Tracker will resume where it
left off.

•  All Traders fully reload their ammo and may swap any equipment amongst their crew.
•  All Traders restore two Health, up to their maximum.
•  The player making the rescue may place their Ship Airlock Board in contact with any airlock door
on the map – it does not have to be the one they used in the original mission. If multiple crews
are taking part in the Rescue Mission, the winner of the original game will place their ship first,
continuing clockwise around the table.

•  The game will end as normal – once all Traders are either defeated or

back on board their ship.

You may only make a Rescue Mission once after each game.
If a Trader is left behind during a Rescue Mission, you will
need to extract them in a different way.

Rescue Missions can be played solo, or other players can join in,
either to rescue their own Traders or to help you rescue yours. Of
course, they may want payment for such a service…

They docked in the closest asteroid and entered the
dark void of the arrival chamber, walking directly into
an ambush! It all happened so quickly. One moment
the Corps were striding in, confident, well trained,
and well-armed; the next they were running for their
lives. The First Born picked them off one by one
and Zool ordered the remnants of his squad back
to the shuttle. Just two others staggered back to the
shuttle and Zool hit the emergency launch. Bleeding
from a scalp wound, Zool directed the shuttle back
through the warp gate and into human space. He
immediately ordered a permanent guard squad to be
placed on the gate.

As the med teams set his broken arm and patched
his wounds Zool reflected on where he’d gone
wrong. He had many flaws but he knew when to
admit that he’d made a mistake. The mistake had
been in sending in his own men.

He should have sent the Traders in first…

Director Zool looked pensively at the report. A crew
of scabrous Traders were claiming that a new alien
species had been recently encountered that posed
a galaxy-wide threat. The location of the species
was extremely distant but ZZ-Alpha, his own sector,
was the closest in the event of a possible invasion.
The ancient gate at the Lagrange point that had
transported the Traders to the alien system had
been damaged and Zool was tempted to just leave
it at that. But… the aliens now knew they existed,
and the report suggested technology far in advance
of their own. Zool decided to take the offensive and
ordered the Lagrange gate to be reconstructed. He
hand-picked a squad of Galactic Corps militia and
loaded them up on the first transporter.

A team of Ech Triune engineers were supervising
the reconstruction of the damaged gate and were
confident that they could render it functional within
24 hours. Zool watched as the grey stone of the gate
was slowly replaced with glittering gold as nano-bots
reversed the damage. An engineer tried to explain
to Zool that the nano-bots were effectively pushing
the gate backwards in time to its former state but he
wasn’t interested – so long as the eggheads could
fix it he didn’t need to know the details.

He’d briefly talked to the Trader crew that were being
held for questioning. They were the usual quarrelsome
riff-raff, full of wild stories, and refusing to go back
as guides. The interrogators had gleaned as much
information from them as they could so he let them
go. The Traders were clearly not up to the task, so he
would lead his squad into the heart of alien territory
himself. They were the best of the best, the Elite, the
Corps with the best training and best equipment.

The Galactic Corps shuttle passed through
the warp gate in stealth mode and
reappeared in unfamiliar territory. The
system had a single white star surrounded
by what looked like millions of smaller stars,
but on closer inspection each ‘star’ was a flat
moon sized disk. Together they comprised a Dyson
sphere as wide as a planet’s orbit.

There was a strange quality to the space around
them, an elasticity. When they looked at the
scanners it felt like they were looking at a still photo
rather than a live feed. Zool sensed his squad’s
discomfort and did his best to buoy them up. Bad
morale could get a unit killed.

The Corps headed towards the asteroid belt where
the aliens - later dubbed the First Born - were
supposed to be settled. There seemed to be no
signs of life and no electrical activity at all. Later,
Zool would wonder if the First Born had been
jamming their scanners all along, leading them to
falsely believe that there was no danger.

MISSION BRIEFING – EXPLORATION
You’ve been given the location of a derelict asteroid reportedly long abandoned by the First Born. As captain of
a Trader ship, caution has kept you alive longer than your aptitude for shooting. Therefore, you decide that an
exploratory mission to the abandoned base would be a good dry run for your crew to help them acclimatise to
the First Born habitat. You can get in, grab any precious tech and minerals lying about and get a feel for what
you may encounter later, all with the minimum of danger. Of course, you’re not to know that the First Born have
returned to reclaim the asteroid!

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Reward: Whatever you can find

You are among the first Traders to arrive in First
Born space, and it’s ripe for the picking. Your
buyers back in the core will pay top dollar for alien
artefacts, so get in, grab as much as you can carry,
and get out.

You’ve heard rumour that the locals don’t take
too kindly to trespassers, but how scary can they
really be?

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE
Reward: Variable

It’s not just physical artefacts that you can get
good money for. Any information you can gather
on the First Born and their ways of life will also
be highly valued.

If your crew is able to install all
four runes into the Command
Console and Interact with
it, the Trader that did so
will earn your crew a 5UA
bonus if they survive the
mission. This is in addition
to the sale value of the
runes themselves.

If your crew managed to collect any
Energy Counters using a piece of
Dyson equipment (see page 103),
each Energy Counter is worth a 1UA
bonus when the item is sold.

Finally, you will earn a bonus based on the Hostility
level when your last Trader leaves the board:

•  Wake Protocols: 3UA
•  Threat Defence: 8UA
•  Cleanse: 15UA

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
CUSTOMISABLE MISSION

This mission is designed to be relatively generic,
for use as a starter mission, or as a chance to
stock up on equipment and cash between other
games in a campaign.

As your collection grows, feel free to add new rules
and NPC types to this mission as you wish, such
as First Born Cerberosa or Prospector NPCs. In
most cases this will simply be a case of shuffling
the relevant cards into the Event Deck.

You can also play this mission with multiple
crews – just remember that once you reach four
crews the Hostility will increase more quickly
and you’ll need to use the First Born Support
cards and miniatures.

MACHINES IN CORE SPACE
Most of the time, Machine characters are used just
like any other in the game. However, there are a
few extra rules to be aware of. These rules apply to
characters with the Machine species on their Trader
Board and/or with the Machine Class Board.

•  Machines have access to the Repair action
and can also be Repaired themselves (see
page 28).

•  Machines can still use their Skills while defeated.
•  Machines are able to self-destruct using the
Overdrive Skill, Level 3. If a 5-6 is rolled on
when using this Skill the character’s chip-set
will remain intact, allowing the character to be
‘revived’ after the game even though their body
is destroyed. This is done in the Trade Phase
after the mission as follows:

The player may hire one of the available
Traders at half the normal price (rounding up).
The new Trader’s Career track is advanced
the same number of times as the
destroyed Machine’s.
The new Trader is automatically given the
Class Board of the destroyed Machine, with
the same Skills selected.

•  Machines are immune to Fear and do not suffer
bites from Rock Worm Larvae. They are also
immune to poison and suffer reduced effects
from fire and certain Skills – this will be stated
where applicable. Fire and Poison can be found
in other Core Space expansions.

SELECTING A CREW
Before you can undertake a mission in Core Space,
you’ll need to assemble your crew.

Crews are hired based on a points limit, agreed in
advance between you and any other players taking
part. These points will be spent on Traders using
the values in the corner of their Trader Boards.
Here you can see that Cassie costs 67 points.

For your first few games you don’t need to worry
about selecting a crew – the crew of the Eidolon
from this box is pre-built to take on the challenges
of the First Born campaign or any standalone
mission, as is any of the other crews available. You
will still need to select some starting equipment –
see Rookie Crews below.

However, once your collection grows and you learn
more about the game you may decide to mix and
match all the characters available and build your
own crew. To do this, we recommend starting with
a limit of around 220 points, but you can agree any
limit you like with your opponents. You must select
Traders based on the following rules:

•  You must select one Captain. No more, no less.
•  You must select at least three Crew, and no

more than six.

You can choose from any of the Traders available,
including Civilians, Gangers, or any other character
with a Trader side to their Board.

CLASS BOARDS
Once you have selected your characters you will
need to give them jobs. For each Trader in your
crew, select any Class Board from those available.
Slot it into your dashboard with your Trader Board,
and allocate the Trader’s Career Points to the Skills
on the board, up to the default value.

It is recommended that all crews have at least one
Trader with the Tech or Machine Class just in case
you need to Repair something during a game.

Note that some Traders may be locked to a
specific class. Hopper for example can only take
the Machine Class, shown by the icon on his
Trader Board.

50

EXPERIENCED CREWS
If you don’t have time for a campaign, but you want
to play with more powerful equipment and skills at
your disposal, you can put together an experienced
crew instead.

Select your Traders as normal, but then agree with
your opponent a starting Career level. Advance
each of the Traders that many times as detailed on
page 60. You can then agree any number of UA
for each crew to spend on equipment, applying a
bonus to the lower-cost crews as usual.

You can also use these rules if you want to play
with an existing experienced crew against a rookie
crew – just allow the rookie player to advance
and equip their crew to the same level that the
experienced player has already reached.

ROOKIE CREWS
Most games and campaigns will start with a
rookie crew – a group of inexperienced Traders
with basic equipment – and it will be up to you to
develop their skills and find new gear as you play
through the missions.

Rookie crews do not start with any Career
advancements and will have their starting statistics.
They can be equipped with a starting budget of
15UA to spend on equipment (see the Trade Phase
on page 61 for more on purchasing equipment).
Any of this budget left unused is lost.

If you are playing a multi-player campaign, players
should take it in turns to purchase equipment
– some things will run out quick! If there is a
difference in points values between crews, the
lower-cost crews will gain a bonus in UA equal
to the difference, to a maximum of 35UA. For
example, if one crew costs 212 points and the other
costs 195 points, the lower cost crew will have an
extra 17UA to spend on equipment – 32UA in total.

The Crew of the Eidolon

THE CREW OF THE EIDOLON
CAPTAIN CASSIE PELTIER
Name: Cassiopeia Peltier; Species: Human; Age: 32

Cassie has an ex-military background serving in
the militia of her home world. After a short stint as a
mercenary she stumbled across the Trader’s life and
hasn’t looked back since. She served as support for
a number of different Trader ships before leasing her
own ship and assembling her own crew. Her combat
suit is a remnant from her military service and gives
her enhanced strength and speed and is equipped
with shoulder mounted cannons. She is a fair and
equitable captain and doesn’t believe in taking
unnecessary risks.

WADE
Name: Wade Gentry; Species: Human; Age: 36

Wade is in it purely for the money. Although he
looks gung-ho he just sees Trading as a job,
nothing more. He would much rather work in a
less dangerous environment but he’s good at what
he does and job opportunities are thin for a man
with his poor education. He’s good at improvising
weapons but he’s more of a tinkerer and hasn’t
quite got the skills to be a Technician. He has no
ambition to be a ship’s captain and is content to
just punch a clock and let someone else make the
hard decisions. Wade met Cassie when they were
working as mercenaries and both agreed they
didn’t think much of the job and quit.

BALCOR
Name: Balcor; Species: Nerind’ar; Age: 60

Balcor is a skilled engineer, the role he signed on
for, but increasingly suspects he was chosen for
his size rather than his skills with a spanner. He
is considerably taller and stronger than a Human
and outweighs nearly any creature he encounters.
His ranged skills are average but he makes up for
it in close combat and will often fight unarmed. He
has a prosthetic arm, the result of an engineering
accident, that he has modified to suit his purpose.
His one regret is that he didn’t get the other one
done at the same time!

Balcor is by nature quite timid and would rather strip
and rebuild an engine than go stalking around a
derelict ship. However, he is a good fighter when his
crewmates are in danger, which is pretty much all
the time.

52

HOPPER
Name: HoP-PA99; Species: Machine (Human origin); Age: 12

Originally designed as a host protocol machine for the more
affluent parts of the Galactic Heartlands Hopper was stolen and
reprogrammed by an enterprising Trader. Modified and filled to
the brim with useful (and some not so useful) protocols Hopper
now functions as ship Tactician, devising strategies to the crew’s
advantage. Not particularly strong in combat skills Hopper makes up
for it with hacking, negotiation and intelligence skills. What Hopper
doesn’t know about Machine systems is immaterial – because
it knows everything about Machine systems. Hopper is also an
excellent ego-free negotiator and has talked its crew out of some
sticky situations.

THE EIDOLON
Even by Trader standards the Eidolon is an old
ship, constructed when space travel was still
novel. Originally a pleasure clipper designed for
short inter-system trips it was only later retrofitted
for Core Space travel.

It is a ship designed by an alien mind with
graceful Art Nouveau lines blended with an
otherworldly aesthetic. Although ancient it has
been well maintained by its various owners and
is currently leased to Captain Cassie Peltier
who treats it with the love and due diligence
this beautiful ship deserves.

STARTING CREW
For your first few games, we recommend allocating Classes and Skills to the Eidolon as follows:

CAMPAIGNS
Campaigns are the thing that take a game and
turn it into a story, and are the best way to play
Core Space.

POST-GAME SEQUENCE
Unlike one-off missions, after a campaign game
there are some additional steps to work out the
impact of the game on your crew.

A campaign is a series of games linked together
with a continuous narrative. Players will select
their crew before their first game and hopefully
keep the same characters from start to finish,
possibly even taking on new recruits along the
way! Your Traders will learn new Skills and acquire
new equipment, all the while striving to keep their
ship in good working order.

The post-game sequence has four phases:

1. EXTRACTION
In this phase, players must decide what to do about
any comrades left behind. They may get kidnapped
by rival Traders, you may mount a daring rescue
mission, or they may be simply left for dead…

This phase is covered on page 58.

Of course, in a campaign Traders can be killed and
their valuable Skills and equipment lost, so players
will need to think twice before throwing a character
into certain death situations!

2. ADVANCEMENT
This phase is where your characters will advance,
learning new Skills and becoming more powerful.

In a campaign, missions are carried out as normal.
However, after the mission is complete the game
is not over – there are some extra steps to carry
out to see how the mission’s success or failure has
affected your crew and their ship.

BETWEEN GAMES
In a campaign it will be important to keep track of
your crew’s progress between games. The dry-wipe
boards will hold all the necessary information so
you don’t have to remember anything, but it may be
a while between games.

It is recommended that you keep your Ship Board,
Character Boards, and current equipment tokens
together in a box or ziplock bag between games
so you can easily set them up again ready for the
next mission.

This phase is covered on page 60.

3. TRADE
Next, you will get a chance to head to the trading
post to buy and sell equipment, and even hire new
crew members, ready for your next mission.

This phase is covered on page 61.

4. MAINTENANCE
Finally, in the Maintenance Phase, you will need
to assess the state of your ship and make repairs
if necessary. You will also be able to upgrade your
ship, allowing it to play a part in your games!

This phase is covered on page 64, but first of all
you will need to understand how ships work – see
page 56.

54

MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGNS
Although you can play through a Core Space story
solo, you may want to introduce your gaming group
to the game too.

The Crew of the Eidolon is just one of many Trader
Crews in the Core Space universe. Each player in
your group can pick up one of the range of pre-built
crews or mix and match their favourite Traders to
assemble their own.

As the objectives are co-operative, you can
even add an extra crew or two to the First
Born campaign if you wish. Set up their airlock
door as close to the starting one as possible.
We would suggest reducing the number of
starting Traders per crew by 1 and possibly
adding the First Born Support cards, but the
exact tweaks you make to increase the difficulty
are up to your gaming group.

The main difference with a multiplayer campaign is
having to arrange regular games to keep the story
ticking along, so let’s take a look at how to do that.

POST-GAME SEQUENCE
The additional steps between games should be
carried out while the players are still together, so
that you can witness each other’s dice rolls and
make trades with each other.

CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE
Once you know how and when your campaign will
start and end, you will need to establish a structure.

LEAGUE-STYLE

More competitive players may prefer a strict,
turn-based structure where every player in
the campaign plays the same number of
games. This way all crews will have the same
opportunities for advancement at each stage,
keeping the game balanced.

Campaigns like this should be arranged in a series
of ‘campaign turns’, in which players will be paired
up, play games, and resolve the results.

Pairings could be made in a ‘Swiss’ tournament
fashion, or as a round-robin, where every player
plays every other player. The exact manner of
arranging games is up to you.

FREE-FORM

For those who prefer the more narrative approach,
a more open structure can be adopted, where
games are arranged based on the story that you’ve
put in place, or simply on the players that are able
to meet up at any given time. This may mean that
players play different numbers of games to each
other, but does make the campaign much easier to
manage, and is much more realistic.

COMPETITION

CAMPAIGN LENGTH
The first thing you will need to decide for your
campaign is its length. Generally players tend to
play out a campaign over a few months in real-time,
meeting up once a week or so to play.

You’ll need to decide whether you’re playing co-
operatively or competitively, and how to decide the
winner. It could be the crew with the most money,
but you may instead choose to reward the highest
value crew, or any other metric you decide.

Alternatively you may want to create a narrative
goal for the campaign – maybe there are reports
of a First Born Talos in the area and the crews are
battling over the chance to take it down and claim
the bounty. Maybe you need to fight your way out of
an asteroid set to self-destruct. Maybe a lucrative
opportunity has been rumoured closer to the First
Born Star, and the crews must upgrade their ships
so they can be the fastest one to get there. These
are just a few examples – what’s best for your
campaign is up to you.

You should then work out the end point. Using the
examples above, that may be completing a mission
where you must take out a Talos, or getting to an
open area after various missions fighting in the
tunnels, or being the first to fully upgrade your ship.
Your campaign will then go on for however long it
takes for this end point to be reached.

PLAYING CATCH-UP
Although battles between unevenly matched
sides can be far more exciting to watch, this is
still a game and it needs to be fair to all players. A
situation may arise in your campaign where one or
more players are significantly behind the others,
or a new rookie crew joins in halfway through. In
these cases, where the difference between crews is
at least 10 UA worth of Traders and equipment, it’s
recommended that these players run through some
extra missions to catch up.

Use the Exploration mission on page 48 between
your regular games – this represents these
underdog crews hunting for valuable salvage
before re-joining the story. The players can play it
solo or together; just once or a few times, until they
are caught up.

SHIPS
The ship is the Traders’ home, their transport and their livelihood. Without a ship a Trader is just a drifter with their
thumb out. Of course, with the state of the galaxy ships need constant maintenance to keep flying and that needs
Flo, Galactic Credits, the old Universal Asset.

Ships are represented in game by the Ship Board, which can be filled in with a dry-wipe pen just like the Char-
acter Boards. In one-off games the Ship Board is only needed as a deployment area – you can ignore these
rules for now.

MAINTENANCE STATUS
This area shows the current state of repair of each of
the ship’s essential systems: Propulsion, Life Support,
Supplies and Hull Integrity. At the start of a campaign,
your rookie crew will only be able to afford a second-
hand ship and it won’t be in full working order – only
the first three boxes on each row should be filled. With
use, the ship will degrade further and so repairs must
be made – this will happen in the Maintenance Phase.
If any of a ship’s systems reach zero the ship becomes
damaged beyond repair and uninhabitable. Unless
repairs can be made immediately the crew will disband
and will be out of the campaign, so be sure to save
some credits for vital maintenance!

SHIP NAME
Each Core Space crew has its own
ship – the crew in this set pilot the
Eidolon. You can of course come up with
your own ship name too. Once you’ve
decided, write it in this space.

HOLD
The hold works exactly like the item tray
on the character dashboard – perfect
for keeping items that you may not want
to sell just yet, but that you don’t want
to waste dashboard space on during a
mission. In the Trade Phase you can
freely swap items between your Traders
and the ship’s hold.

ASSETS
This is where you will note down how much money you
have to spend. This will fluctuate as you buy and sell
items and hire new crew in the Trade Phase. Once all
purchases have been made, the remaining amount
should be written here ready for the following game.

Note that it’s wise to keep some funds available, just
in case you need to pay a release fee for a captured
crew member, or for other expenses that can crop up
during missions.

56

UPGRADES
In the Maintenance Phase assets can be spent to install the various upgrades shown here (see page 64).

Ship upgrades work exactly like Trader Skills – they have multiple levels that can be unlocked, and their abilities are
used by spending Skill pegs in the Trader phase. Any member of the ship’s crew on the board can spend their Skill
pegs to use the upgrades – this will count as their Skill use for that round as normal.

The cut-out removed from the hold area of the Ship Board contains easy
reference for these upgrades.

You may reduce the Hostility by up to 2. Then, based on the

(including First Born) due to turn up this round. You may modify
any of the location rolls by 1, up or down. Place them next to the
appropriate Entry Point, off of the board for now. They will not be
rolled for again in the later Phases – they will just be placed onto
the board and activated as normal.

You may move your airlock to any other point on the same side of
the gaming area as its current location.
You may move your airlock to any point along either side of the gaming
area perpendicular to its current location that had an airlock starting
position on the map.
You may move your airlock to any other point on the opposite side
of the gaming area to its current location that had an airlock starting
position on the map.

THE AIRLOCK
On the back of the Ship Boards you will find the airlock. This
is the area where Traders are deployed at the start of the
game. The edge with black and yellow hazard markings is
the door, and should be placed in contact with the edge of the
board. The Designation box is a space to write your name, or
the ship’s name, just in case ships get mixed up if they move
around the board.

You will note that this side of the board also shows the Hold
and Upgrades sections. Any upgrades made to your ship
should be marked on this side of the board too, for quick
reference during the game.

57

EXTRACTION PHASE
So, you’ve managed to get back to your ship, but
you’ve left a comrade behind. The fate of the fallen
is now in your hands. Your defeated crew members
have been left defenceless, and will need to be
rescued, or left for dead…

In this phase you will deal with any crew members
that did not make it off the board by the end of the
mission. Of course, if your crew all made it out, you
can skip this phase.

For each defeated Trader, first roll the Knowledge
Die. If you roll a 1 your character has succumbed
to their injuries and is permanently dead. The
character can no longer be used for the rest of the
campaign and all of their equipment is lost. You’ll
need to hire a replacement.

If they manage to dodge this fate, instead choose
one of the following options:

•  Rescue Mission
•  Emergency Teleport
•  You’re on Your Own

Furthermore, if none of your crew made it out,
and you have no other crew members on board
your ship, you will not have the Rescue or Teleport
options. All of your Traders must roll on the ‘You’re
On Your Own’ table on page 59.

RESCUE MISSION
You may decide to mount an immediate Rescue
Mission to get your Trader back. See page 46 for
more details.

EMERGENCY TELEPORT
All Traders carry an emergency teleport beacon
just in case, but they all dread actually using it.
In fact, the less bold specify that they’re not to be
rescued by teleporter under any circumstance!

If you choose to teleport the Trader out, roll the
Knowledge Die to see what happens:

1.  The Trader dies in transit. They may

have been turned inside out, beamed into
space, or maybe they’ve been merged
into the fabric of the ship. Whatever awful
fate befell them, the Trader and their
equipment are lost forever. They can no
longer be used in this campaign.

2.  Teleporters are notorious for pulling cruel

tricks on the unwary. The character arrives
safe and well, but they are not the same
person they were when they left! Shuffle
all Trader Boards not being used for the
current campaign (if you have none,
re-roll this option). Pick one at random –
this is your Trader’s new identity – swap
out the model and Trader Board for the
new one. The new Trader will retain the
same number of Career points as they
had before, but the player can choose
a different Class Board and allocate the
Career points differently if they wish. The
character’s equipment remains the same.

3.  The character is teleported safely, but
to the wrong ship! It will take a while to
find and retrieve them. Either the Trader
misses the next two missions, or the
player can pay 4UA to have Galactic
Central Data locate the lost Trader and re-
teleport them immediately.

4.  The Trader has survived the trip, but there
has been an accident and they are in a
poor way. They take longer to recuperate
than normal and they must miss the next
mission. However, the character learns
from the experience – they gain 1 Career
Point.

5.  The Trader is teleported safely onboard,
but their equipment did not survive the
trip. Their equipment is lost and must be
discarded.

6.  The Trader is teleported safely onboard

along with all their equipment. There is no
further effect.

58

PERMANENT CREW LOSS
Traders that are lost permanently following the
Extraction Phase are removed from your crew.
Their Trader Board may appear again in a future
Trade Phase when hiring new crew, but just think of
it as a similar-looking Trader rather than the exact
same person! The new Trader can of course have a
completely different Career path.

If your Captain is ever permanently lost, you have
two choices.

•

If another Captain becomes available in the
Trade Phase of the current game, you can hire
them as your new Captain.

•  Alternatively, you can promote one of your other
Traders to Captain. Immediately advance their
Career by an extra point, and from that point on
all rules that apply to a crew’s Captain will apply
to them.

It’s unlikely, but in the event that every member of
your crew is permanently lost, you are out of the
campaign and must start afresh with a new crew.

YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN
Maybe you don’t want to risk the teleporter, but
don’t have the resources for a rescue mission? In
that case you will have to leave your companion to
fend for themselves and hope it works out.

Roll the Knowledge Die to see what happens:

1-2    Ransom: The unconscious Trader is picked up

by a less honourable crew or criminal gang.
You will need to pay a ransom of a number of
UA equal to double their Skill statistic to get
them back. If you do not pay immediately you
can pay later, but the ransom will increase by
2UA per mission.

If you don’t want to pay, you may choose
to leave the character to their new life as
a criminal. From now on the character
can never be chosen as a Trader, but
may be used as a Ganger NPC using the
Civilian side of their card (if Gangers are
being used).

3-4     Apprehended: The Galactic Corps have
arrested your fallen crewmate and placed
them in a local holding facility. To see what
trumped-up charges they are given, roll the
die again:

1: The Trader is released without charge
and sent back to your ship.
2-3: The Corps demand a 5UA release fee.
4-5: The Corps demand an extortionate
10UA ‘release fee’.
6: There is no bribe big enough – your
Trader is going down. Roll the Knowledge
Die – your Trader misses that many
missions while they serve their time. All of
their equipment is lost.
If you roll a 2-5 and can’t or don’t want
to pay the release fee, treat this as if you
had rolled a 6 instead.

5-6     Escaped: Your crewmate wakes up just in time

and manages to slip away on an evacuation
shuttle. They make their way to an agreed
pick-up point and you retrieve them. You will
have to pay 3UA for fuel and other expenses.
In addition, one random equipment token they
were carrying is lost/sold for safe passage.
If you do not want to pay the fee, you
can leave them behind. The character is
left for dead and can no longer be used
for the rest of the campaign. All of their
equipment is lost with them.

ADVANCEMENT PHASE
Finding new equipment isn’t the only way to
improve your Traders’ abilities on the table. As they
survive missions and gain experience they will also
learn new Skills.

As detailed on page 8, each Trader’s Board lists
their Career statistic, representing their current
ability level. The default spaces will be filled in at
the start of every standalone game or campaign,
but it is in this Advancement Phase where the
potential spaces can be filled in too!

EARNING CAREER POINTS
While filling out the first row of their Career
track, each time a character survives a mission
and makes it back to the ship during the game
(regardless of whether they completed their
objectives or not) they gain 1 Career point – fill
in the first empty space on their Trader Board.
Characters that require extraction do not gain any
Career Points.

When filling out the second row, the character
must survive the mission and their crew must have
completed the mission’s primary objective.

Once a Trader is onto the third row they will only
gain Career points in special circumstances,
including but not limited to the list below. These are
cumulative where applicable.

•  Personally completing a primary mission

objective. E.g. being the one to defeat a specific
enemy, destroy a specific terrain piece, escape
with an objective, and so on. This will not apply
to all missions, and any applicable objectives
should be agreed with your opponents before
the mission.

•  Defeating four characters in a single round.
•  Completing a mission’s primary objective and
surviving while using at least two fewer crew
than allowed by the mission.

•  Single-handedly dragging a defeated Trader off
of the board from a distance of at least medium
range from your airlock.

•  Allowing another crew to escape on your ship

(once per mission, captains only).

You may agree with your opponents to bestow
further Career Points based on impressive feats in
your games such as a particularly powerful dice roll
or a selfless act of heroism.

SPENDING CAREER POINTS
These additional points can then also be allocated
to the character’s Skills on their Class Board. Pick
a Skill that you want to advance and fill in one of
the spaces next to its icon. You will be able to use
this Skill at a level equal to the number of marked
spaces from your next game onwards.

KILL POINTS
Defeating certain enemies can make a Trader’s
Career, so to speak. The Trader that defeats a True
Born in a game takes the relevant Kill Point Counter.

This counter is exchanged in the Advancement
Phase after the game for additional Career points.

LEVEL UP!
Each row of Career spaces on a Trader’s board is
a level. Filling all the spaces on a row allows the
character to level up, which has added benefits.

•  When level 1 is complete, the Trader gains 1

Health Point and 1 Skill Point (and the relevant
pegs) for all future games.

•  When Level 2 is complete, the Trader gains 1

further Health Point and 1 further Skill Point for
all future games.

•  When Level 3 is complete the Trader gains 1

further Health Point, 1 further Skill Point, and 1
Action for all future games. This character is now
maxed out and will not advance any further.
•  Once a Trader’s Career track is full, any Career
Points they gain thereafter will be added to
any of their other stats with spaces remaining
(player’s choice).

Note that some Traders do not have all three Career
levels – they can only level up as far as their Trader
Board will let them. Also note that statistic increases
are only gained where the potential spaces are
available on their Board – if all spaces are filled the
Trader will not advance any further.

TRADE PHASE

No sooner had they heard of a wealth of precious minerals and alien technology to exploit,
the galaxy’s Traders, freeloaders, entrepreneurs and assorted riff-raff headed straight there!
The fact that those goodies belonged to a dangerous species bent on genocide was a small and
overlooked inconvenience.

The result of this mass migration is Trading Post 5, a waystation hastily established in a crater on an
abandoned asteroid just beyond the Lagrange Point. Here an enterprising Captain can hire traders,
mercenaries and other useful hands and stock up on fuel, machines, equipment and weapons in an
eclectic bazaar of stores, workshops, bars and dens of iniquity.

Constructed primarily from shipping containers and an old atmosphere processor the trading post can be
quickly disassembled and moved to another location should the First Born become too aware of them.

The outpost attracts a colourful assortment of dubious characters and ne’er do wells; exactly the sort
of tough, shifty types you’d expect in the final outpost before untold wealth or grisly death! The sole
proprietor, Daric, a retired trader and suspected pirate, will welcome you with open arms – but only if
you’ve got something he wants!

This far out from the galactic core the trade that
Traders rely on can be hard to come by. Luckily,
Trading Post 5 is a one-stop-shop for almost
everything a Trader could want.

In addition, standard items with the
rare and also cannot be bought. These items can
only be found or awarded during missions that
use them.

 icon are

In the Trade Phase the Traders take their salvage,
and any reward for completing their mission
objectives, and visit the trading post where they can
buy and sell items and hire new crew!

When buying an item, reduce your assets by its
cost, and then take it and add it to your ship’s hold
or a Trader’s item tray. If you do not have space for
any more items, you cannot purchase any.

Items are bought and sold using the game’s
currency – UA. The cost of buying and selling items
is shown on the back of the token, as shown below.

When selling an item, increase your assets by
its sale price, and then return the token to the
appropriate supply/token pouch.

This value is
the number
of UA you
must spend to
purchase this
item from a
store.

This value is
the number of
UA you will
gain when you
sell this item
in a store.

Note: If a sale price is shown in red, it means that
the item must be sold – these items can only be
used for a limited time and will not last until the
next mission. Also note that the Energy
Counters stored in any ‘Dyson’ items
only apply their bonus (see page 103)
in the game after they were collected.
Otherwise the energy dissipates and
must be collected again in the next game.

You will note that you will usually get back less than
you spent if you were to buy and then sell the same
item, so make sure you get some use out of it!

The green First Born tokens cannot be purchased and
do not have a buy value - they can only be obtained by
looting the First Born asteroid temples. Be careful when
you sell them as you may never find them again!

Stock is limited to the available tokens. In a
multiplayer campaign, the winner of the most recent
mission will get first pick of any items, alternating
thereafter. If there was no winner, flip a coin to
decide who picks first.

VIP AREA
Although crude, Trading Post 5 has rules – you
can’t just go anywhere. Invites to the most
exclusive parts of the post must be earned!

Items with a buy cost of more than
20UA  can only be purchased if
your crew contains a Trader with
Career level 2 that survived the
preceding mission.

Each player can purchase a maximum of one item
from the VIP area per Trade Phase. Players with a
Level 3 Trader can purchase two items.

CRAFTING
As detailed on page 26, the walls of the First Born
asteroids can be mined for valuable minerals.
These can either be sold or they can be taken to
the workshop where a skilled engineer can use
them to craft powerful hybrid equipment.

Kalamite

Herrilium

Dialena

For example, these values mean that the Herrilium
crystal can be sold for 3UA or used for crafting
wherever the orange triangle icon is seen.

Hybrid equipment will include
these triangles in its buy value
in addition to a UA cost. For
example, this powerful Breach
Pistol requires two Herrilium crystals and one
Kalamite crystal plus 45UA to craft.

Important: All mineral tokens must be returned to
the supply/pouch between games. If you choose
to use a mineral for crafting, but do not want to
craft an item just yet, note it down with your stored
UA to use later. The same will apply if a mineral
token gives you two different minerals and you only
choose to use one of them.

BARTER
Money isn’t the only thing you can trade with. At
any time during the Trade phase you can choose to
barter with your fellow players – maybe they have a
rare item that you will pay over the odds for.

What and how you trade in this manner is
completely open – it’s up to the players to strike
a deal in whatever way they see fit. You could let
someone else hire the Civilian you just rescued,
offer assistance in the next mission, or even trade
one of your crew members, for the right price. The
only thing you can’t trade is your Captain.

HIRING CREW
Inanimate objects aren’t the only things available
at Trading Post 5 – there are plenty of mercenaries
out there who will join your crew for the right price.

Note that you may never have more than 7
crew members.

There are three ways of hiring crew, as follows:

HIRE ‘ON-MISSION’

During a game you may have persuaded an NPC
to join you temporarily. However, if you can safely
get them back to your ship, as a reward for keeping
them safe during the mission you can permanently
hire them at a reduced rate – see the Costs table.
Any NPC with a Trader side to their character board
can be hired in this way.

STANDARD RECRUITMENT

While at the trading post, you can visit the
makeshift bars and mercenary agencies to scout
out new talent. Each player should take all the
unused character boards with a Trader side from
their collection, shuffle them, and draw the top 5 (or
fewer if you don’t have 5). These are the Traders
available for hire at this time.

Any or all of these Traders can be hired in two
different ways – either as a permanent member of
the crew, or as a temporary hire, fighting with you
for the next mission only. The costs are as detailed
in the table on this page.

Remember that a crew can only have one Captain.
Any Captain Trader Boards that come up in this
phase can only be hired if you lost your Captain in
the previous game.

Traders hired temporarily will stick around until the
following Trade Phase and will be added to the
selection of Traders available at that time. This
will allow you to hire them again if you wish, either
temporarily or permanently, and they will retain any
advancements they gained during your previous
mission. If you choose not to hire them again, they
will lose any advancements and become available
as part of the random selection in future games.

62

COSTS

All costs are based on the points value of each
Trader as detailed on page 50, and will change
depending on whether the Trader is hired on-
mission, temporarily or permanently, as follows:

CREW UPKEEP
Crew that can survive in this galaxy are highly
sought after, and they won’t stick around if they don’t
feel valued. At the end of each Trade Phase you’ll
need to pay your crew a bonus for their efforts.

All Traders in your crew will require a payment
of 1UA for each level of their Career Track that
contains any points, with an additional payment of
1UA if they took part in the most recent mission.

Your Captain does not require payment and neither
do crew just hired in this Trade Phase.

If you can’t afford or choose not to pay for a
Trader’s upkeep they will leave the crew, losing
any advancements they have gained. You can
keep their equipment if you have space to store it;
otherwise it must be sold or discarded.

MAINTENANCE PHASE
Trader crews rely entirely on their ships. They
require constant maintenance to keep them
running – if they become damaged beyond repair
they must be abandoned and the crew will be out
of the campaign.

REPAIR
After you have rolled for degradation, you will have
a chance to repair your ship. Making a repair will
fill in one space of your choice in the Maintenance
area of the Ship Board, but it will cost you! For each
repair, roll the Knowledge Die:

As described on page 56, the Maintenance Status
section of the Ship Board shows the ship’s current
state of repair across its four systems: Propulsion,
Life Support, Supplies and Hull Integrity. These
levels will rise and fall during this phase.

DEGRADATION
First, each player must roll the Knowledge Die and
consult the following table to see which of the ship’s
systems has deteriorated with use.

•  1-2: You find someone with a (probably stolen)

stockpile and pay a measly 2UA.

•  3-5: You’ve found some good quality parts but

to secure the purchase it’ll cost 5UA.

•  6: This is the only merchant with these parts in
First Born space, and you’re going to have to
bid high – the cost is 9UA.

There is no limit to the number of repairs you can
make during a phase, and repairs can be made
across all four of the ship’s systems.

1.  Roll twice more on this table and apply both

results (re-rolling further results of a 1)

2.  Propulsion reduces by 1
3.  Life Support reduces by 1
4.  Supplies reduces by 1
5.  Hull Integrity reduces by 1
6.  Equipment Malfunction – choose one

random equipment token with a sale value
of up to 5UA from those held by your crew
and in your hold, and discard it.

Don’t forget, if any of a ship’s systems reach zero
the ship becomes damaged beyond repair and
uninhabitable. Unless you can repair the ship in
this phase, the crew will disband and will be out of
the campaign.

OUT-OF-PHASE DEGRADATIONS

Note that no matter when during or after a game
a ship’s systems are degraded to zero, you
will always have until the end of the following
Maintenance Phase (which may be two games later
in the case of linked missions) to repair the damage
before the crew is forced to disband.

You must roll separately for each repair. If you’re
not happy with the price and choose not to make
the repair you cannot roll for that system again until
after the next game.

Note that some equipment tokens found
during missions can be used to fix your
ship. These can be spent to make up to
the number of repairs stated on the token,
to the same or different systems, at no cost. Any
unused value is lost.

UPGRADES
When a ship is fully maintained, with no spaces
left unfilled, you can instead turn your attention to
upgrading your ship. The available upgrades are:

•  Scanners
•  Airlock Auto-Defences
•  Docking Thrusters

These are fully detailed on page 57, and each has
three different levels. You can only purchase a new
level for an upgrade once all previous levels of that
upgrade have already been purchased. Upgrades
cost the same as ship repairs, plus the following
premium based on their level:

•  Level 1: 1UA
•  Level 2: 2UA
•  Level 3: 3UA

A maximum of one upgrade can be made in
each Maintenance Phase. Once an upgrade has
been applied, you should mark it on both sides of
your Ship Board for reference during your games.

If your ship degrades, upgrades that have already
been applied can still be used.

64

THE FirsT Born CAMPAiGn
Over the following pages you will find detailed
mission briefings telling the story of Cassie Peltier
and her crew’s adventures into First Born Space.

This is a campaign designed for a single player or
up to three/four (see below) players playing co-
operatively using the crew of the Eidolon from this
set. Each of the missions can be played individually
if you wish, but the campaign will work best when
played as one continuous story using the campaign
rules on page 54.

The fourth crew member is not introduced until a
little way into the campaign, but if you have four
players from the start, one player could control the
First Born and other NPCs instead of using the AI.

sTArTinG CrEW
To begin, take Cassie, Balcor and Wade. Hopper
should be left in the box for now – you will have a
chance to join up with it during the campaign. One
player can control the entire crew, or the Traders
can be split between multiple players.

Choose the starting equipment for your Traders as
detailed on page 51.

sinGLE Missions
If you are playing single missions without using the
campaign rules, your characters will be missing out
on the experience and income gained through the
earlier games. No need to worry however – each
mission after the first lists various upgrades that
you can apply to your crews before starting the
game. Do this as described for Experienced Crews
on page 51.

EQUiPMEnT AnD nPCs
You will need the following items for this campaign.
Remove them from the supply and set them aside,
adding them to missions where instructed:

Artifact Fragments

3UA 10UA
Dyson Rods

Artifact fragments found may not be sold during the
campaign – keep them in your possession. You’re
not sure why, but you have a feeling that they are
more powerful than a simple fragment of rock
would suggest.

The two Game Hunters Caaligorn and Keats may
not be hired as Traders unless specified otherwise.
Other Traders can be hired as normal only after you
have completed Mission 6.

Iconoclast Shard

Mantle

There’s nothing more suspicious than a wide open door, even more so when the Galactic Corps
stand to the side beckoning you in. You’ve heard that there’s a fortune to be made by any Traders
bold enough to step through that door and into First Born space. You know better than to trust that sort
of talk, but in these lean times you can’t afford to be choosy. Knowing you might not live to regret it,
you steer your ship through the Lagrange gate…

The crew of the Eidolon approached one of the thousands of asteroids in the First Born system. “This
looks quiet enough,” said Cassie Peltier, the Captain. She liked to err on the side of caution. Only fools
rushed in, a painful lesson taught to her early in her career.

“We’ll let those other mugs strip-mine the Dyson sphere for resources,” said Wade, one of Cassie’s
team. “By the time they realise they’ve flooded the market we’ll be clutching the real gold in our sweaty
little hands.” Wade was from Earth, a notorious backwater planet in the Sol system.

The final member of the crew, Balcor, was so huge he had to stoop everywhere in the ship. He was
the engineer and would rather be somewhere a little less dangerous, although you wouldn’t know
it to see him in close combat. “Bring us in nice and quiet, Balcor,” said Cassie. “Hopefully we won’t
encounter any of the aliens..”

Mission BriEFinG 1 – WHo GoEs THErE?
The crew are in good humour, already imagining spending their ill gotten gains, but you’re not so sure. You
didn’t like the way the Galactic Corps stood back and watched as you entered First Born space, grinning like
sharks as the little fish swam by. Very little was known about the First Born other than that they seemed ancient
and powerful and not keen on intruders. But they were also sitting on valuable technology and minerals, all
there for the swiping. However, the First Born are coming out of a long slumber and aren’t yet organised,
hopefully you can go in quietly and avoid trouble.

You carefully pilot your ship to the quietest looking asteroid you can find. There are no signs of life and with
luck it’ll stay that way… Spoiler alert – It doesn’t!

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Alien Riches

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Bragging Rights

It’s early days in this latest adventure, and you
haven’t yet found a higher purpose, although you’re
sure one will find you soon enough!

In the meantime, stick to what you know and
salvage whatever unearthly valuables you can from
this temple before the time comes to leave.

The First Born aren’t the only threats inside these
asteroids, as you are learning very quickly! The
enormous worms living inside the rock remind you
of horror stories of old, and taking one down would
be a story to tell for many years to come.

The first Trader to defeat a Rock Worm in this mission
gains an additional Career Point after the game.

Mission BriEFinG 2 – Don’T sPArE THE roD
You found some good tech on your last mission and there’s no reason to suppose there’s not more just lying
around in the dust, neglected and waiting to be appreciated by an attentive Trader crew. You choose another
asteroid at random and your preliminary scan seems promising. However, this asteroid seems more active
than the last so you instruct your crew to go in careful. You’re salvagers, not soldiers. They’re an experienced
team so they know all about being paranoid but you can’t help clucking like a mother-hen as any good Trader
captain should. You point out that the stasis pods can be destroyed before the Liege awaken. That’s pretty
ruthless coming from you, but if it’s a choice between the lives of your crew and unknown dangerous aliens
your crew will always come first.

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: 10UA

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Free Labour

Hungry for more after your previous expedition, you
are on the hunt for more alien tech. Your scanners
have picked up some sort of power source – the
3UA Dyson Rod on the floor near where you’ve
docked your ship.

The wounds from your first battles against the
First Born are not just physical – they’ve gotten
into your heads and left your crew jumpy. They are
particularly creeped out by the Lieges, and keeping
those at bay would put the crew’s minds at ease.

Using its power signature you are able to detect
a much stronger signal coming from deep inside
the rock.

A higher-value 10UA Dyson Rod should be placed
in the opposite corner of the board as shown
on the map. This is your objective. It’s hidden
inside seemingly impenetrable walls, so
you will need to find a way through, either
by manipulating the First Born Command
Console, or by finding a Crystal Shard Key.

Stasis Pods can be destroyed in this mission. They
have a physical armour of 2 and a single hit will
destroy them. Once a Stasis Pod is destroyed it
will no longer spawn a Liege if applicable, and any
tokens inside are destroyed along with it.

Mission BriEFinG 3 –WE’rE GoinG on A BUG HUnT
You’re stealthily hunting through an asteroid and come across unusual ballistic and laser damage that
doesn’t look like it was made by the First Born – it looks like someone got here before you! An emergency
beacon leads you to Caaligorn and Keats, two big game hunters after the ultimate thrill. They’ve been
hunting Rock Worms but have been cut off from their exit route by the First Born. After some good-
natured haggling you agree to escort them back to Trading Post 5. The game hunters have some
impressive firepower and despite being too gung-ho for your tastes you wonder if they might make a good
support crew as the First Born are getting harder to evade.

VEnGEFUL HUnTErs

Note that although you can defeat the Game
Hunters to sell the trophies yourselves for full
value, there are risks. If you attack a Game Hunter
in this mission, all Game Hunters will treat your
crew as enemies for the rest of the campaign.

sinGLE Mission

When playing this as a single mission, advance
all Traders’ Careers by 2 points. Spend an extra
25UA on equipment.

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Up to 20UA

A couple of eager Game Hunters have infiltrated
this area on the hunt for Rock Worms, but they
were not prepared for the First Born guarding their
path and have sent out a message for aid.

You must meet the Game Hunters, protect them
while they carry out their mission, and then give
them safe passage back to Trading Post 5 on
your ship.

The Game Hunters will not activate (other than
their free retaliation attacks) until your Captain has
Interacted with one of them. From that point on
they will follow their normal rules.

The exit point for Game Hunters in this
mission is your airlock door.

For each Game Hunter that escapes
the board carrying a trophy, you will be
paid 50% of its value – 10UA.

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Temporary Traders

You cannot normally hire the Game
Hunters in this campaign. However, if
you can Persuade a Game Hunter to join
your crew during the mission, they can be used
as a Temporary Hire in mission 4 at the usual cost,
and in addition to the normal starting crew.

Mission BriEFinG 4 – HoP To iT
You’re scouting for a new asteroid to investigate when you pick up a weak distress signal. It seems that a
protocol droid has been abandoned while collecting data. You’re surprised no-one went back for it as proto-
droids can be worth a lot, especially if they’ve been hacked. One of those could be a valuable addition to the
crew as a ship’s tactician, interpreter or negotiator, depending on what black market software has been packed
into its brain case. It could also have collected valuable data.

Things have been getting progressively tougher, a new crew member could swing the odds in your favour. You
hope the machine is worth risking the lives of your crew!

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Hopper

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Up to 14UA

Hopper was collecting data from a Dyson Reactor
when his owners pulled out of the sector, deciding
that their robot was disposable. Without another
directive, Hopper carried on collecting data. Your
objective is to find Hopper and give it a new role as
a member of your crew.

Use the Trader side of Hopper’s board, with its
usual starting statistics. Hopper will not activate
until another Trader from your crew has Interacted
with it. When this happens, you can control Hopper
for the rest of the game. If Hopper escapes on
board your ship, it becomes a member of your crew
for the rest of the campaign.

If you fail to get Hopper back to your ship during
this mission, it will become available for hire in the
Trade Phase instead after Mission 6.

Once Hopper is under your control, he reveals
details of surveillance devices that he has planted
as part of his data collection. Select two Entry
Points at random, and place a nano
Objective adjacent to each one. These can
be retrieved and sold in the Trade Phase for
7UA each.

Daric looked at the Engram. “Interesting tech,” he
said. “As far as we can tell it compresses years of
learning into a few seconds. It’s designed for the
First Born but I’ve heard that other species can use
them in a lesser capacity.” He was an older man,
clearly an ex-trader but with a hint of the criminal
about him. He was sole proprietor of Trading Post
5, a makeshift trade station precariously close to
the First Born.

“I think once the eggheads back home catch wind
of these they’ll be a surge in demand,” said Daric.
He handed the Engram back to Cassie.

“We’ve actually got quite a bit of interesting tech,”
she said. “If you’re in the market?”

“If you don’t mind, Captain, I can negotiate the sale
for you?” interjected Hopper.

“Okay, Hopper, I’ll be propping up the bar.”

Daric gave a sour look; he clearly didn’t like
haggling with machines. Cassie walked over to
another of the container stores where Wade was
sat next to what could be described as a creature
that was part animal, part vegetable and possibly
part mineral.

“Hey, Captain, have you come to help me empty this
store of its fermented vegetable products?” Wade
turned to the creature. “No offence, pal.” The creature
turned what was presumably its back to him.

“Yeah, sure, this is a trading post. If you’ve got
anything too rich for me I’ve always got contacts.”

“Two of whatever he’s having,” said Cassie to the
barkeep, a tall, twitchy robot.

Cassie motioned to Hopper who approached
from the other side of the encampment. It was
hard to tell with machines but Hopper seemed
happy with his new position as ship’s Tactician.
Hopper dumped the contents of a huge backpack
onto the counter.

“Hmm,” said Daric. “You’ve been busy.”

“Everything you see’s for sale,” said Cassie. She
looked around her as Daric inspected the goods.
“These all your staff?” she asked.

“Naw, most are customers or just hangers on.
Some of them are traders looking for work.”

“Yeah? That could be useful.”

“I was not expecting this sort of setup on First Born
soil,” said Wade. He looked around at the Trader
encampment, a market composed of repurposed
containers held within a shielded crater amidst the
ruins of a First Born settlement.

“Yeah, the owner seems to have a brass set,” said
Cassie. The robot placed two glasses of dark,
viscous liquid before her. “God, Wade, what are
you drinking?”

“I got the mech to knock up a bit of home brew.
Knock it back, Cass, it’ll put hairs on your chest!”

“That’s not a prerequisite,” she said as she
knocked back the first glass in one swig. “A fine
vintage,” she said, through gritted teeth. “Keep
‘em coming, barkeep.”

* * *.

Later, back on board the Eidolon, Hopper went over
the accounts with Cassie.

“What about the weapons?”

“Good to go.”

“We have a choice to make,” said Cassie to her
crew. “Quit while we’re ahead or keep pushing on.”

“Any luck crafting stuff?”

“Naw, you’ve got a choice to make,” said Wade. “I’m
just the hired hand. I’ll go with whatever you decide.”

“Well, we’ve made some good money,” said
Cassie. “But I’m pretty sure Daric ripped us off a
bit, some of that equipment has never been seen
by human eyes.”

“Yes, I’ve combined some of the First Born minerals
and tech to improve some of our equipment. I think
you’ll like some of the new tricks I’ve come up with.”

“Okay, then I think we can risk a few more runs.
There were some likely sorts at the encampment if
we need more warm bodies.”

“He was a tough negotiator,” said Hopper. “But also
the only negotiator this side of the Lagrange point.”

“I think we’ve been lucky,” said Balcor. “We’ve
managed to catch the First Born on the hop. Did
they seem more organised to you when we went on
that last raid?”

“They did,” said Cassie. “I kept a couple of the
Engrams aside. Daric thought we might be able to
use them, what do you think, Balcor?”

“Yeah, a little tweak here and there and I’m pretty
sure we can. It might only be a marginal advantage
though, a quicker reflex here, a new skill there. The
Engrams are designed for First Born minds so we’ll
probably never unlock their true potential.”

“What about those two big game hunters you
rescued before me?” asked Hopper. “I liked the
look of that nice Mr. Keats with his movie star
good looks.”

“That’s a very odd thing for a robot to say,” said
Wade. “Does your software need recalibrating?”

“You’re odd!” said Hopper. “You obviously prefer
that Caaligorn!”

“Er, well…”

“Forget it!” said Cassie. “We’ll make do. Balcor,
show me this box of tricks.”

Mission BriEFinG 5 – BrinG ‘EM BACK ALiVE
You’re preparing to leave Trading Post 5 when Daric approaches you with an interesting proposition.
He’s concerned that rival trading posts may set up shop in First Born space and wants an edge over his
competitors. Daric wants you to capture some of the First Born alive and bring them back to him, he’ll then sell
them to the highest bidder. It sounds suspiciously like slavery to you, but the money’s good and you’ve got
mouths to feed. When asked, Daric admits that the big game hunters are not interested in hunting intelligent
creatures, just dangerous beasts, so you’ll have to do. With a bitter taste in your mouth you agree to the job
and talk it over with your crew, strategising how best to go about it.

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Up to 20UA per captive

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Variable

Daric has charged you with capturing live
First Born (rank 2 and above), and you have
secured two Stasis Field Generators for the
task, represented by nano Objective tokens.

These new trading posts springing up are a good
market for selling raw materials. While they are
new to this area you should get a good price for ore
before the market gets flooded.

All mined Minerals are worth double their sale value
if sold in the Trade Phase following this mission.

To activate a stasis field, the Trader carrying it must
spend an action while in base contact with the First
Born you want to capture. Place the token onto the
First Born’s base. While it remains in contact with
that Trader it will not activate.

Once per turn, the Trader may make a Move action,
moving the First Born with it. The Trader may use
their other actions as they wish but may only Move
with the First Born once.

If the First Born is no longer in contact with the
Trader for any reason, discard the Objective token
– the First Born will act as normal from then on.

True Born can only be captured in their “Wounded”
state – not before or after.

Captured First Born taken back to your ship can be

Mission BriEFinG 6 – MEMorY TECH
True to Daric’s prediction interest in the Engrams has surged. This is partly due to Daric’s own questionable
side-line in live First Born… The black market, arms dealers and the occasional legit scientist have become
excitedly aware of the Engram tech implanted in the bodies and armour of the First Born.

The First Born use Engrams to enhance their physical or mental performance, sometimes even warping the
immediate reality around them, but to you they’re just worth money. Arms dealers will pay handsomely and
even the Galactic Crime Commission will gladly take them off your hands for their research. Retrieve as many
Engrams as possible by any means possible and sell them while the demand is high.

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Inflated Prices

Your task is to find as much Engram Tech as
possible and sell it while demand is high. The
following items are Engrams:

Mission BriEFinG 7 – rEPAir THE rEACTor
A reactor on a First Born asteroid is going critical. Normally you’d shrug your shoulders as there’s plenty of
other asteroids to loot but unfortunately you happen to be stranded on it! After picking up massive energy
readings and hoping for some high-end tech to salvage you landed your ship on the asteroid only to
immediately experience a critical power drain. A deep scan revealed that a Dyson reactor is close to meltdown
and caused the electronics to surge on an asteroid-wide blowout. You need to prevent the Reactor from
exploding before your already fragile ship is damaged beyond repair. Get in there and science it up!

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Your lives

The Dyson Reactor has gone critical, and an
explosion would cause catastrophic damage to
everything in the surrounding area, including your
ship. Your objective is to deactivate the Reactor
and escape to your ship.

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Whatever you can find

While you’re stuck here you may as well make
the most of it – you’ll need money for ship repairs
anyway. If you’re lucky you may even find one of
those peculiar Dyson devices that could help drain
the energy from the Reactor…

sPECiAL insTrUCTions
iMPEnDinG EXPLosion

The Dyson Reactor
starts the game
active. At the start of
the game, place 10
Energy Counters
on the Hostility
Tracker. In each
Assessment
Phase two of
these Counters
are added to the Reactor instead
of the usual one. When no
counters remain on the Hostility
Tracker, the Reactor will explode.

If the Reactor explodes, all characters in the
same room as it are permanently killed and out of
the campaign. All other characters on the board
suffer a four-dice attack. Your ship immediately
suffers three Degradation rolls.

sTABiLisinG THE rEACTor

Any Trader that Interacts with the Reactor twice
in the same turn will prevent one Energy Counter
from being added at the end of the round.

Dyson items may only remove one Counter from
the Reactor per action in this mission.

In addition, once in play, the nearest Liege to the
Reactor will ignore the AI chart and will instead
move towards the Reactor. This Liege will not
make any actions when it activates unless it has
previously been attacked by a Trader, in which
case it will act as normal, following the chart.
Other NPCs will not target this Liege.

For every full turn that it spends in contact with the
Reactor without making any other actions you may
also prevent one Energy Counter from being added.

All other Lieges will act as normal.

To remove Energy Counters from the Reactor
Traders may make Repair actions on it. For
each success scored, discard one Counter.
Once all Counters are removed, the Reactor is
deactivated.

Mission BriEFinG 8 – THE TUrnCoAT
As you’re about to board your battered ship a portal appears and a Liege steps through. Something in
its demeanour makes you order your crew to stand down. The Liege speaks in its alien tongue and the
environment translates in a blaring monotone. A renegade faction of True Born, including the Liege’s own
leader, have gone insane and plan to awaken a godlike being that has slept for millions of years. The internal
politics of the First Born are not your concern but you know how serious it must be for a Liege to betray its
master. The Liege will force the True Born Stasis Pod into the open and delay its opening. It implores you to
help jettison the pod and the True Born into space, for although it may point the gun at its leader it could never
pull the trigger.

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: 20UA

Your mysterious mission is to take
out the True Born, and the Liege has
provided you with two more Stasis Field
Generators, again represented by nano
Objective tokens.

The fields can be activated on the True Born
Stasis Pod, as well as the True Born itself when
in its “Wounded” state. They can be used on
other First Born, but there is no reward for their
capture in this mission.

To activate a stasis field, the Trader carrying
it must spend an action while in base contact
with the True Born or its Pod. Place the token
onto the True Born’s base. While it remains in
contact with that Trader it will not activate. If the
Pod has been captured, while in the Stasis Field
Reminder Counters will not be removed and the
Pod will not open.

Once per turn, the Trader may make a Move action,
moving the True Born/Pod with it. The Trader may
use their other actions as they wish but may only
Move with the True Born once.

If the True Born/Pod is no longer in contact with the
Trader for any reason, discard the Objective token
– it will act as normal from then on.

The True Born can be sold for 20UA, with a 5UA
bonus if it is still inside its pod.

You can also defeat the True Born and drag its
body back to your ship for a reduced 15UA reward.

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: First Born Assistance

If you complete the Primary Objective and the
Liege survives this mission, it will continue to assist
you in Mission 9 – you may deploy the Liege with
your crew at the start of the game and control it in
the same way as this mission.

sPECiAL insTrUCTions
sETUP

The board is setup exactly as it was left at the end
of the previous mission, with any defeated Traders,
Searchable terrain, counters, equipment, and non-
First Born NPCs still in position. Any First Born that
were on the board are removed, and the Hostility is
reset to the level for this mission.

Then place a Liege and three Drones as shown on
the map. No additional Drone is placed.

THE LiEGE

The Liege that starts the
game on the board is here to
help, and will be under your
control for the duration of the
mission, or until it is defeated.

It will be targeted by its own
kind as if it were a Trader, but
you can use its actions and
abilities in full, including the
effects of the Knowledge Die.

THE TrUE Born

Do not roll for True Born arrival as normal in
this mission. When the Hostility reaches Wake
Protocols, the True Born Stasis Pod is immediately
placed at a random Patrol Point, with three
Reminder Counters.

In each Assessment Phase remove one of these
Counters. Once all Reminder Counters are gone
the True Born will emerge.

The Stasis Field will prevent Reminder Counters
being removed.

Mission BriEFinG 9 – on THE oFFEnsiVE
When you get back to Trading Post 5 the rumours are flying thick and fast. Everyone’s heard of the First Born
‘god’ and everyone has a theory, but what you’ve learned from the turncoat Liege is more troubling than the
wildest rumour. If what you’ve heard is true then the First Born are a threat to the galaxy as a whole. Going
against your own nature for survival you decide to prevent the Insane God’s awakening even at the cost of
yourself and your crew.

The location of the ‘God’ and the codes to revive it are inscribed onto an ancient tablet that was broken into
pieces and hidden amongst the True Born. The traitor Liege gave you the location of the only surviving True
Born member of a fanatical faction that wishes to revive the God. Get there and recover the tablet fragment
before the True Born does.

it too and has sent its minions to intercept you!

You need to find this fragment and get it back to
your ship.

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: Valuable Minerals

After speaking with some Game Hunters you
have discovered a potential new revenue stream,
albeit a dangerous one! It turns out that the
writhing of the Rock Worms inside their tunnels
often loosens crystals from the rock, leaving
them free for anyone to pick up.

A Trader may Interact while standing on an
open Worm Hole to enter it. The Trader may
immediately take a number of Mineral tokens
from the pouch equal to the number of open
Worm Holes in play.

Then roll the Knowledge Die and place that many
Reminder Counters on the Trader’s Dashboard.
While they are there the Trader may not activate
– they are inside the Worm tunnels.

In each Assessment Phase, remove a Reminder
Counter and then draw another Mineral token
from the pouch as if that Trader had performed a
Mine action.

If a Rock Worm would arrive at the same Hole
as the Trader, the Trader is immediately placed
on a different random open Hole, if possible. Any
remaining Reminder Counters are removed, and
the Trader suffers a Fear Counter. If there are
no other open Holes, the Trader is eaten by the
Worm and removed from the campaign.

Stasis Pod in addition to the standard items. Then continue with Mission 10.

Mission BriEFinG 10 – sAVE THE GALAXY!
You now have in your trembling hands three of the tablet shards. Using a form of psychometry, the Liege is
able to ascertain the location of the final piece. The fanatical True Born keeps it literally close to its chest so
you will need to defeat it to retrieve the final piece. There may be other members of the renegade faction, now
or in the future, who would use the knowledge to their advantage. The tablet shards cannot be destroyed so
they must be hidden, assuming you survive the final confrontation with the True Born the Liege instructs you
on how it can be achieved.

PriMArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: A safer galaxy

sEConDArY oBJECTiVE
Reward: First Born Riches

The Liege has provided instructions for how to
safely hide the assembled
Artifact from the fanatical
True Born and its
followers, but doing so
will involve taking the
final fragment from the
True Born itself!

The four Artifact
fragments must each be
placed into one of the
four pillars on the board. A
Trader may Interact with a
pillar to place a fragment
from their tray into the slot
in the top of the pillar.

Once all four are in place, a Trader may Interact
with the Command Console to activate the pillars,
phasing the Artifact to a safe location on a distant

EPiLoGUE

Things are starting to heat up. The First Born are now fully mobilised and clandestine raids are
much harder to carry out. Other Traders are also getting in on the action and stirring up a hornet’s
nest. You’ve probably saved the galaxy but more importantly you’ve made some good booty and
decide to quit while you’re ahead.

Just as you are about to leave via the Lagrange point something very strange happens - the whole
star system moves out of sync with the rest of the galaxy. If you didn’t know better you’d say that it
was moving towards the populated part of the Perseus-Orion Arm. But how could that be possible? A
star system can’t move like a space ship…

Then you remember the Liege said that controlling the gravity field of the First Born star was
something the Insane ‘God’ could do. You think of the turncoat Liege and its inhuman smile when you
last saw it... and you wonder if it was playing a crooked hand all along?

You’ve completed the campaign, but it doesn’t
end there. The next jobs will need more credits,
upgraded ships and more powerful weapons.
You can replay the campaign in endless ways in
competitive or co-operative play. You can also play
through the missions and campaigns from the other
Starter Sets and Expansions available and use the
additional crews and terrain to bolster your Core
Space experience.

New Core Space missions are made available
regularly on our website:

It’s a tough galaxy out there but remember…
happy gaming!

COMBINING GAMES
Core Space: First Born is the second starter set
for Core Space. Many players will also have the
original starter set that pits the Traders against the
robotic Purge in place of the alien First Born. This
section takes a look at how both games and their
related expansions can all be used together as part
of one big Core Space sandbox.

MIX AND MATCH
Most Core Space components are designed to be
modular and can be combined with no extra rules
required. First and foremost, Traders from all starter
sets and expansions can be assembled in any
combination to build your crew. While some equipment
tokens may only be found/purchased in a certain
way (First Born Minerals for example), tokens of the
same type can be mixed and matched to your heart’s
content, regardless of which set they came from.

The terrain can of course also be used for any game,
especially if you enjoy creating your own missions!

ON LOCATION
The main difference between the starter sets
is the setting, be it the outskirts of the Barrens
in the galactic core, or the asteroid belt in First
Born space. In gameplay terms this setting is
represented by the Hostility Tracker and the
enemies it generates (Purge or First Born), and the
accompanying Event Deck.

If not playing a pre-designed mission where this
is decided for you, at the start of each game the
players should decide on a location and use the
Hostility Tracker and Cards to match. The same
will apply to the equipment and terrain setup, i.e.
whether you fill crates with standard equipment,
or whether you fill Arks and Stasis Pods with First
Born equipment, and whether you can mine the
walls during the game.

Keep an eye on the Battle Systems website too –
we regularly release new missions, and with the
arrival of the First Born we’ll be taking a look at
what happens when worlds collide, so you can use
your whole collection at once!

CAMPAIGNS AND CREWS
The Campaign rules across the starter sets are
largely the same, although they have been made a
little tougher in First Born. We recommend that you
use the First Born Campaign rules and costs for all
games, with the exception of the locations in the
Trade Phase. These will depend on your game’s
setting – in the galactic core the regular locations
will be available instead of the all-encompassing
Trading Post 5.

Considering that you’ll be using the new, tougher
campaign rules, you should also use the rules from
this book to assemble your initial crew.

NPCS AND EVENTS
Your setting will determine the main NPC enemy
(Purge/First Born), and most missions will specify
the other types of NPCs used.

For custom or amended missions, you can use any
combination of NPCs from your collection.

Game Hunters are intended for use in First Born
space as there are not yet any Beasts for them
to hunt in the galactic core, but you could always
create a mission where someone has released
Rock Worm Larvae in a city, or you could have the
Hunters track down a Purge Annihilator instead, or
even a Trader!

Prospectors may be best suited to First Born space,
and Workers might make more sense in the galactic
core, but there’s no reason you can’t come up with a
mission objective that could use any of them.

Obviously Civilians, Gangers, Galactic Corps and
the Media can be found in all locations, and this will
be explored further in the Trading Post 5 and In the
Line of Fire expansions. When using these NPC
types, you should shuffle in the matching Event
Cards from all sets in your collection to ensure the
NPCs will enter play.

The Hostility band names may not always match up,
but there are a couple of ways to address this. You
could choose to simply have two trackers running
side by side for Event Card purposes, or alternatively
match up the Hostility bands as follows:

•  Relaxed/Guarded = Patrol
•  Watch Your Back = Inspection
•  Cover Me = Aware
•  Charge = Wake Protocols
•  Kill Me = Threat Defence
•  Purge = Cleanse

If a rule comes up on an Event Card that doesn’t
apply (it refers to the Purge for a game in First Born
space for example), just resolve as much of the
card as possible and ignore any part you can’t, as
normal.

THE GOLDEN RULE
As with all things Core Space, the golden rule here
is that it’s totally up to you. The benefit of such a
wide-ranging and detailed universe is that you can
immerse yourself in it and tailor your games to fit
your collection and your imagination however you
see fit. Most importantly, have fun!

REFERENCE – TERRAIN
The terrain pieces in Core Space First Born are
all interactive and will often be key to a mission’s
success. The rules for each piece are explained
here. In addition, all terrain pieces will block line
of sight to some degree and provide cover as
explained on page 13.

DOORS

HIDDEN DOORS
Some wall sections contain barely-visible openings,
where the living rock of the First Born asteroids will
open for characters to pass through.

While closed, non-First Born characters treat these
as regular walls for all rules purposes. The First
Born can move through these doors freely, leaving
them open behind them. They still cannot draw LoS
through them when closed.

They can be opened when specified by a
mission or by using the Command Console.
They can also be passed through by a
character with a Crystal Shard Key.

PILLARS
While these are mostly for LoS
blocking and cover as you’d
expect from something that
holds the roof up, they do have
a slot in the top for an equipment
token or counter. This will be
used for mission objectives that
may involve taking or activating
something on each of the pillars
around the board. Missions will specify when to use
this slot.

ARKS

Arks are the First Born equivalent of storage chests
or crates, and contain equipment that your Traders
can pick up and use. At the start of each game you
will fill the Arks with a random selection of items,
and you will need to Search these during the game
to loot their contents. They can hold up to four
small or nano tokens.

Some wall sections contain doors which can be
removed to mark them as open or closed.

Unless specified otherwise in the mission, all doors
are considered to start the game open and unlocked,
and can be seen and passed through freely.

For Traders and all non-First Born NPCs, opening
or closing a door is an effortless action when in
contact with the doorway – simply place or remove
the door as appropriate.

When closed, doors are treated as part of the wall
and completely block line of sight.

Locked doors are different in that they must be
unlocked, breached or hacked before they can be
opened. Missions will usually specify how and when
doors can be locked and unlocked. Otherwise, this
can be done with the Command Console (see page
92), the Laser Cutter item, and some Skills, among
other things.

When using First Born
terrain, all First Born can
pass through unlocked
doors freely even when
closed. They will unlock
locked doors by spending
an action.

Lock Markers
can be slotted
over the top of a
wall to
mark a
door as
locked.

90

STASIS PODS

EXHAUSTS

These sleep chambers house the First Born Lieges
while in stasis, along with their personal effects.

The pods can be placed either upright or laying
down and have removable lids for large amounts
of equipment to be hidden inside. They are
Searchable and can hold any number of tokens of
any size.

However, don’t forget they also accommodate a
sleeping Liege! Searching these pods during the
Patrol or Inspection Hostility levels will
deactivate the stasis field and cause the
Liege inside to die. Mark the pod with a
Search Counter to remind you that this
has happened.

When the Hostility reaches Aware, any Stasis Pods
that have not been Searched immediately spawn a
Liege, if one is available. This is in addition to any
other Lieges arriving in that round. Place the Liege
in contact with the terrain piece and it will act as
normal from then on.

TRUE BORN STASIS
CHAMBER
The True Born has a
specialised sleeping pod
for long term stasis, housed
within the rock. It will emerge
from the rock at a Patrol
Point when the True Born
starts to wake up. This is
detailed in full on page 38.
Otherwise the chamber
simply blocks movement and
LoS through its square.

These vents expel excess gases and pollutants
from the reactors inside the First Born asteroid
bases. They will be activated in game when
instructed by Event cards, and when in operation
they will be marked with a 3D flame marker.

While active, LoS cannot be drawn through the
four squares containing the exhaust, potentially
providing partial cover to anyone that can be seen
around the edges.

In a similar way to Rock Worms, the venting gases
will damage anyone foolish enough to be close
by. The resulting cloud of flame and smoke affects
the entire area within two squares of the Exhaust.
Any character of any type that is adjacent to the
Exhaust when it activates suffers an immediate
attack with three dice. Any character within two
squares suffers an attack with two dice.

Any character that enters this area (intentionally or
otherwise) also suffers an attack (two dice if within
two squares, three if adjacent). This interrupts
their movement, and they can continue their action
after the attack if they survive. Characters will also
suffer an attack when any other action is made
while within this area, resolved after the action
is complete. This still applies even if a character
wastes an action by doing nothing.

DYSON REACTOR

This device collects and processes the energy from
the First Born’s star to power their temples, and this
energy can be harnessed or exploited by the Traders!

These rules do not need to be used for every game
– in missions where the energy collection rules are
not used for the mission objectives the reactor can
be left inactive to provide cover if you wish.

Otherwise, the reactor will use the following rules:

•

It remains inactive during the Patrol, Inspection
and Aware Hostility levels, simply providing cover.

•  As soon as the Hostility reaches Wake

Protocols the reactor will activate. Open the top
of the reactor to show that it is active.

•  While active, in each Assessment

Phase place an Energy Counter into
the reactor to represent the power it
is accumulating from the star.

•  Some missions will specify a method for Traders
to collect and use this stored energy. Otherwise
it can be collected using any ‘Dyson’ equipment
with the icon to the right (see page
103). A Trader may Interact with the
reactor to take any number of Energy
Counters from the reactor and place
them on their equipment token.

•  Once it has accumulated at least one Energy
Counter, the reactor will become volatile.
Characters may choose to target it with an
Assault action. It has a physical armour value of
3 and any damage caused will destroy it.
•  When destroyed, nearby characters suffer

an attack with a number of dice equal to the
number of Counters in the Reactor. The range
of the attack is a number of squares also equal
to the number of Counters. For example, if it
has accumulated four Energy Counters, all
characters within four squares suffer an attack
with four dice. The blast does not pass through
walls but ignores cover modifiers.

92

COMMAND CONSOLE
This archaic console taps into the
inner workings of the First Born
temples, diverting power and
rearranging the living rock.
It is activated by four
runic stones guarded
by the True Born’s
attendant Lieges.

At the start of a
game that uses
the console, the
four runes are
each placed into
a different Stasis Pod
around the board in addition to any other equipment.
They can be collected using a Search action as
normal. Note that some missions may specify
alternative locations for the runes.

When in contact with the console, a Trader can
insert or remove a rune using an effortless action.
Runes are physically placed into the slot in the
centre of the console.

Once one or more runes is in place the console is
active and Traders can Interact with it to resolve
any one of the following effects:

One or more runes installed

•  Unlock and open or close and lock any

standard door on the board.

Two or more runes installed

•  Open or close any Hidden Door on the board.
•  Deactivate stasis fields – add a Search Counter to
all Stasis Pods, preventing Lieges from emerging.

Three or more runes installed

•  Activate or deactivate the Dyson Reactor.
•  Activate or deactivate an Exhaust.
•  Engage auto-defences – make an attack

against any character on the board with three
combat dice.

Four runes installed

•  Deactivate an Entry or Patrol Point. This point
can no longer be used – flip the counter to
remind you. Only one point can be inactive
at a time – deactivating a different point will
reactivate the previous one.

If carried back to the ship, runes can be sold for
2UA each. They cannot be kept for future games.

RefeRence - SkillS
This section contains all the rules for the Skills shown on each Trader’s Class Board (and in some cases
their Character Board). Each is represented by a colour-coded icon that matches one of the Skills in this

cHARAcTeR ABILITIes

This is the rank of an NPC.

When making a Move action, this
character can move an additional
number of squares equal to the number
inside this icon. They are still limited to
the 11-square maximum.
When making a Close Assault
action, this player rolls dice equal
to the number inside this icon when
unarmed. If the Trader chooses to
use a weapon, they use the weapon’s
statistics instead.
This character has a permanent
physical armour value equal to the
number inside this icon, even when
they are not wearing armour. If they
wear armour, they use whichever
value is highest.
When this character moves into contact
with an enemy, it gets an immediate
free Close Assault action.
Once this character has been
defeated, the player can roll a number
of combat dice shown in the icon in
each Trader Phase. If a hit is scored,
the Trader may stand back up and
restore Health equal to the number
of hits. This is their entire activation
for that round. This can only be done
once per game.
Scramble: This icon allows characters
to climb over objects and scenery and
is optional for the purposes of the core
game. It is most commonly used for
games using multi-level terrain.

The top number is the maximum height
or width of items in inches that the
character can ignore when moving. The
character may move over them without
penalty but may not end its move on
them.

The bottom number, and other uses of
this icon for Climbing and Jumping, are
explored in more detail in the advanced
rules in the Deluxe Rulebook. If using
those rules, they replace those stated
here.
This character is camouflaged and
can only be targeted by ranged
attacks from within short range.

This character can hover above the
ground with the following benefits:

 (X = the number in the icon)

•
•  They ignore the first hit of

any Attack of Opportunity against
them.

•  They cannot be knocked prone.

They are still subject to any other
parts of a rule that would normally
make them prone.
This character is Massive.

Massive characters can be seen past/
over smaller characters. Any character
with a lower number in their Massive
icon, or no Massive icon at all, will
not block LoS to a Massive character,
but may provide cover following the
normal rules.

Massive characters reduce Knock
Back attempts against them by the
number shown in the icon. They also
add this many automatic hits to their
own Knock Back attempts.

Massive characters can move items
(and characters that are smaller
than them) at their full speed. Other
characters cannot and do not need
to help them. Massive characters
themselves require one more
character than normal to move them
(two characters to move 2 squares
and three to move at full speed).
This character is Small.

Small characters will not block LoS
to regular or Massive characters,
but may provide cover following the
normal rules.

Terrain will generally provide a greater
level of cover to Small characters as
they cannot be seen over the top, but
the same terrain may impede LoS for
the Small characters themselves.

As usual, roll the Knowledge Die to
determine the level of cover if you are
unsure.

Small characters can be moved by a
single character at full speed unless
that character is also Small.

ITeM ATTRIBUTes

This item is rare and cannot be bought. It
can only be found using the Search action
during a mission.
This item can be used as an effortless action.

When this item has been used, flip the
token face down. There will often be an
alternate effect on the back, but otherwise it
cannot be used for the rest of the mission.

Some items do not get ‘used’ as such but will
still have this icon. Flipping the token (usually
as an effortless action,) will then trigger the
effects shown on the back instead.
When this item has been used, discard it
and return it to the supply.
Items with this icon can be used to make
Mine actions.
This item is a Trophy and will act as a target
for a Game Hunter (see page 42). It can be
sold for its value if claimed.
The character may re-roll a single die
from each attack with this weapon. If this
icon is not on a weapon (if it is on a Target
Laser for example) then the icon can be
applied to a single weapon the character
is holding – place them next to each other
in the character’s tray.
The character may re-roll a single die from
any ranged assault attack.

Burst Fire +1: You may add 1 combat
die to your attack, but you must remove 1
extra ammo peg.
Burst Fire +2: You may add up to 2
combat dice to your attack, but you must
remove the same number of extra ammo
pegs.
Full Charge Shot: You may empty
your weapon in one powerful blast. This
removes all ammo pegs. Either:

•  Add 2 combat dice to your attack if 4-5

ammo pegs were removed.

•  Add 3 combat dice to your attack if 6-7

ammo pegs were removed.

Infinite Ammo: This weapon does not
use any ammo pegs (and can be fired if
you have no ammo), but one peg must still
be added to the Hostility Tracker from the
supply if applicable.

Reliable: This weapon ignores
unless accelerant ammo is used.

 results

Super-Reliable: This weapon ignores
results even if accelerant ammo is used.

102

Target Lock: This weapon ignores partial
cover, and can fire at engaged characters at
any range without randomising the target.
Silent: This weapon does not add a peg
to the Hostility Tracker.
Sustained Fire: If this weapon hits, you
may immediately make another ranged
attack with the same weapon as an
effortless action. The second attack must
target the same enemy, or an enemy
within short range of them.
Instead of firing normally, a Ranged
Assault action with this weapon can be
used to fire a grenade token at up to
medium range instead of short.
Standard bullets fired from this weapon
that miss their target will return to the
gun (accelerant ammo is discarded as
normal). When firing, remove the ammo
pegs as normal but set them aside until
you roll. For each point of damage caused
discard a peg, up to the number set
aside. If any pegs remain, return them to
your dashboard. Regardless of whether
damage is caused, a peg must still be
added to the Hostility Tracker if applicable.
Stim: Restore 2 Skill pegs.

Stim: Restore 2 Skill pegs. This may take
the user beyond their starting Skill.
Stim: Restore 2 Health pegs.

Stim: Restore 2 Health pegs. This may
take the user beyond their starting Health.
Stim: Take 2 extra actions this turn.

Reload 7 standard ammo pegs, replacing
any different pegs in your dashboard.
Reload 7 accelerant ammo pegs, replacing
any different pegs in your dashboard.
This weapon freezes the target and they miss
their next turn. No dice roll is needed. Roll
dice as shown for any characters within 1 and
2 squares respectively. Any hits will freeze
them too, regardless of armour or cover.
Reaction: Use the Timewarp Grenade
immediately after a character in short
range and LoS has activated. Roll one
combat die. On a hit, fully reverse the
effect of the target’s last two actions. They
are still marked as activated. On a blank
or a misfire, reverse just their most recent
action. After use, mark your character
with a reminder counter – they will lose an
action in their next turn.

This item scatters the target the number
of times shown, or twice if no number
is shown, with no attacks of opportunity
allowed. Roll a single die – on a double hit
you can choose the direction; otherwise it
is determined by the Knowledge Die. The
target can be scattered through a wall or
terrain piece but cannot end its move on
top of it. They cannot be scattered off of the
board but can be scattered into mid-air if
using multi-level terrain, in which case they
will fall from their current height. Roll dice
as shown (if any) for any characters within
1 and 2 squares respectively. Any hits will
scatter them too, in a random direction.
Note that this can be used on a friendly
character, or even the user themselves.
Dyson Equipment: This item extracts and
stores First Born energy. The first hit of
each First Born ranged attack made against
the holder of this item is negated, and an
Energy Counter is placed on top of all items
held with this icon.

Each item can hold a number of
counters up to the limit shown
in the icon. If this number is
exceeded, the item overloads
– it is destroyed and the holder
suffers an attack with a number
of dice equal to the maximum
number on the item.

The item has no effect if a character is
wearing or benefitting from shield armour.

When sold, its value is increased by a number
of UA equal to the counters on the item.
This item can be used to make ranged
attacks at up to medium range. The number
of dice rolled is equal to the number of
Energy Counters discarded during the attack,
which may be some or all of those available.
This item can be thrown at an enemy. The
number of dice rolled against the target is
equal to the full number of Energy Counters
on the item. As usual, the thrown token will
land on the floor next to the target, with no
Energy Counters remaining.
This weapon is used in Close Assault.
Instead of rolling dice it applies a single
automatic hit.
Physical Armour cannot negate hits from
this weapon.
Shield Armour cannot negate hits from
this weapon.
This weapon allows you to Reload as an
effortless action.

This item cannot be used in the same
mission that you find it – turn it face down
to remind yourself.
Each turn, this character may spend up
to the number of actions shown to give
that many actions to another character
carrying an item with this icon, to be spent
in their next turn.
When used, this item gives the Trader
the physical armour value shown for the
number of rounds indicated (this includes
the current round). Place the token over
the Trader’s armour slot and remove it in
the Assessment Phase after that many
rounds have passed.
When thrown, as long as at least one hit
was scored this item is not removed from
the thrower’s item tray. If no hits are scored
it will be placed next to the target as normal.
When used, this item allows the user to
make a Move action that can pass through
all walls and other terrain, but cannot end
on top of them.
When used, this item allows the user to
make a Ranged Assault action with any of
their weapons, at up to the range shown,
that can draw LoS through all walls and
other terrain.
This item deflects First Born energy. First
Born ranged attacks made against the
holder of this item are reflected back at the
attacker, applying cover as if the holder of this
item had made the attack, but still using the
Knowledge Die and other effects if applicable.

These items will have a limited number of
uses, rotating the token after each attack
until it is flipped or discarded.
Items with this icon are part of a larger
item made up of multiple tokens, and
are worth more when sold with their
corresponding parts. The price per item is
shown on the back, based on the number
of items sold at the same time.
Items with this icon can only be used in pairs,
with each held by a different Trader. When a
Trader uses one of the items, flip it and the
corresponding item face down, and swap the
positions of the two Traders on the board.

When using First Born terrain, a character
carrying this item can pass freely through
closed and locked doors, as well as
Hidden Doors (see page 90). Doors that
they pass through will remain closed and/
or locked if they already were.

Here you will find a few additional notes on various
items to clarify their use.

AcceLeRAnT AMMo
This ammunition features a chemical accelerant
that enhances the power of each shot.

Accelerant ammo can be loaded in
the same way as regular ammo using
 icon. Use the
an item with the
orange pegs instead of the yellow
ones. If you wish to start a mission with accelerant
ammo loaded, discard the accelerant ammo token
at the start of the mission and give the character a
standard ammo token for free.

When using accelerant ammo:

•  Add one combat die to the attack, plus an

additional die for each additional peg spent
(when using Burst Fire for example).

•  Accelerant ammo misfires more often – a single

fIRsT BoRn WeAPonRY
Remember, when a Trader uses the green First
Born items, they work in the same way as standard
weaponry with two exceptions:

•  First Born items ignore all the effects of

on the dice, so they will never jam or break.
•  First Born weaponry cannot be combined with

items that upgrade standard weaponry such as
the Target Laser.

RoTATInG ToKens
Some tokens have multiple-use or timed effects,
such as the Liege Ring. These effects will be
shown on different sides of the token. When placed
into your item tray these tokens should be oriented
so the text on the back is upright.

Only the effect shown the right way up is
available for use. When the item is used, rotate
the token 90º clockwise. If rotating the token
shows a

 icon, do this immediately.

 or

In the example of the Liege Ring above, the
item is a weapon giving your character a
ranged attack with four dice on the first
and second uses, three dice on the third
use, and then it is discarded.

If an item is not ‘used’ as such and provides a
constant effect like physical armour (e.g. the Burst
Vest), it is rotated in the Assessment Phase.

no Icons?
Some items do not have any icons and therefore
have no in-game effects. They can however be
traded or sold after the mission in a campaign.

UsInG ITeMs on oTHeRs
Note that items do not have to be used on
the character holding them – they can also
be used to benefit a friendly character in
base contact. For example, you can use
a Medi-Stim to restore a comrade’s health
directly, without having to pass it to them first.

sPecIfIc ITeM noTes

Nano Tokens: All of the smallest
half-size tokens are referred to as
nano equipment. Due to the advanced
and expensive technology required to
make these items so small, all nano
equipment is Reliable (

).

Nano items will often upgrade other
items you are carrying rather than have
an effect on their own. For example,
the Sniper Sight applies its benefits to
another ranged weapon.
Rock Worm Larvae: When Searching
or Mining you may discover a Rock
Worm Larva and get a nasty bite! Your
Trader suffers the number of hits shown
on the token, ignoring physical armour.
Machines are not affected. The token is
then discarded.
Skills: Items such as the Matter Shifter
(Manipulate Skill) apply Skills to a
character exactly as if they were on the
character’s Trader Board, except that
the token is flipped instead of the Trader
spending a Skill peg.
Laser Cutter: When using the rules
for doors on page 90, this allows a
character to unlock and open a locked
door in base contact.
Jump Pack: The Jump Pack is used
as an effortless action. It allows the
character to make a Move action using
the Scramble icon shown on the token.
Mines and Detonators: Mines (left)
have no use on their own – they will only
work when paired with a
detonator (right). A mine can
be thrown or dropped on the
floor as an effortless action. The
detonator can be used later in
the game, also as an effortless action.
It must be used within the range shown
(LoS not required) to resolve and
discard one mine. If more than one crew
has a detonator they will not trigger each
other’s mines. Use different coloured
reminder counters to mark the mines
each crew can detonate.

Shard Fins: These are used as
an effortless action. They allow the
character to make a Move action using
the icons shown on the tokens.
Necro Flask: This flask contains an
invigorating fluid, but its effects are
quickly degenerative. The item can be
thrown at a Trader, even if defeated,
or can be smashed on the user
themselves. It adds four Health pegs
to the Trader’s Dashboard (reviving
defeated Traders in the process),
which may take them over their
starting level as long as there is space
on the dashboard.

Place the token on their character board.
The character will automatically lose one
Health peg in each Assessment Phase
until they are defeated.
Sypher Orbs: When used, these items
allow you to look at the next one or two
Event Cards depending on the item, and
then put them back in the same order.
Repair Fibril: These items can be
used when making a Repair action
to automatically apply the number of
Repair points shown, instead of rolling.
Any unused amount is lost.

They can also be used in the
Maintenance Phase after the game.
Instead of rolling for the cost of ship
parts, you can make a number of repairs
up to the value shown, to the same or
different systems, only paying 2UA in
labour. Any unused amount is lost.
Caaligorn’s Rifle: This item can only
be obtained by disarming Caaligorn as
detailed on page 43.
Exclusive Items: Some weapons and
items are exclusive to a character,
species or Class, such as the Neoflex
Plate exclusive to Machines. This will be
marked on the token as shown.
