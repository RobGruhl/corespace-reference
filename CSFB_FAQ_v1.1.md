Equipment
Standard Equipment
Item Attributes
Q: Do items with the deflect icon, such as the
Ecco Orb, which reflect First Born energy, also
‘reflect’
the knowledge die or
other effects?
A: The hits from the ranged attack are reflected
back against the attacker, applying the effects
of cover if applicable. Other effects associated
with the character attacking or the action used
to make the ranged attack, e.g. knowledge die
results on First Born attacks, still affect the
original target. [BGG]

Q: Is throwing an item an effortless action, or
only those marked with the ‘tick-in-a-circle’
effortless action item attribute?
A: Throwing as an effortless action requires
only a number in the burst damage or thrown
damage statistic [CSFB p.15, 30]. A thrown
item does not need the printed effortless action
icon, and any such icon printed is redundant.
[For further discussion of this topic, see p.5]

Q: Do multiple instances of
the same item
attribute ‘stack’? What about multiple instances
of the same effect, such as a Military Machine
Pistol (re-roll a die icon) with a Target Laser
(re-roll a die in a crosshair icon)?
A: No and No. Having the same icon more than
once in this instance still just confers the ability
to “re-roll a single die” [CSFB p.102]. If multiple
items confer a numerical bonus, just use the
highest value (e.g. armour, CSFB p.23). The
Military Machine Pistol
is a misprint, it should
be the re-roll in a crosshair icon, as no ranged

weapon has the re-roll
crosshair.

Flipping, Rotating and Discarding
Q: If an icon has a rotate symbol after each use
(such as the Liege Ring or square ammo box)
does it remain rotated between missions or
does it ‘refresh’, i.e. being placed back into the
dashboard with the writing on the reverse the
correct way round?
A: Items such as this which are not discarded
during the mission are refreshed between
missions [GOTCHA with a CS via BGG]. Items
which must be discarded after a period of time
when used, such as the Burst Vest, must still
be discarded even if the mission has ended
before discarding has happened [FAQ v1.2
p.3].

First Born Equipment
First Born Energy
Q: What attacks involve First Born energy?
A: Any ranged attack (those with the crosshair
icon) from a First Born character or First Born
equipment item (green tokens, such as a Liege
Ring) involve First Born energy. Items such as
an Ecco Orb, which deflect First Born energy,
reflect only the hits of the ranged attack. Other
effects, such as the knowledge die from a First
Born attacker or conditions conferred by the

attack, such as fear or poison, apply to the
original target.

Q: What would happen if a character with a
deflection item, such as an Ecco Orb,
is
attacked by a character using First Born energy
and has a deflection item themselves?
A: Traders may attack one another (such as
those from competing crews) and use First
Born equipment items. For example, Trader A
uses a Liege Ring to make a ranged attack
against Trader B; if Trader B had any Dyson
equipment, 1 hit would be absorbed and it
would gain an energy token. If Trader B had an
Ecco Orb it would be rotated once, and the
attack would be deflected back against Trader
A;
if Trader A also had an Ecco Orb the
process of rotating the token and reflecting the
attack is repeated until either
the repeated
effects of cover (removing one hit result from a
ranged attack roll)
the
deflection items are rotated enough to be
flipped or discarded and the attack can be
resolved against a character without deflection.

Setting up the game
Tokens
Q: What do I do if I have multiple copies of the
First Born Equipment Sheet (such as via the
Kickstarter Edition), should I include multiple
copies in the green token pouch?
A: You should only use one copy of any
equipment sheet, including standard equipment
or First Born equipment (see CSFB LtP p.6 for
an image of the First Born Equipment Sheet).
When setting up the game, keep any additional
copies of such items in the box. Then, first
remove any key items from the supply (as
described in the mission briefing or campaign
notes). Second, fill any terrain pieces. Thirdly,
any remaining square green First Born tokens
are placed in the green token bag along with

tokens.

Q: Are True Born tokens part of the general
tokens that
First Born supply? What about
come from other expansions, such as the
Insane God?
A: No, remove any green token which includes
a white icon referring to a special NPC type,
such as the True Born, and keep them

separate [CSFB p.14]. These are only used
when a rule tells you to, such as when a True
Born wakes up and two True Born equipment
tokens are taken at random and placed into the
slots on the Awake side of its character board
[CSFB p.39]. Some items have a white special
enemy icon on their reverse, which means a
special item must be retrieved by defeating the
corresponding First Born to craft it, e.g., the
Guardian’s Bane weapon can only be crafted if
your inventory includes 1 Kalamite, 1 Herrilium
and 1 Dialena as well as the 20UA-value token
dropped when a Guardian has been defeated
[FotIG p. 4]. These items may be kept in the
general supply.

back into the deck and draw another [CSFB
p.19].

Specific event cards
Q: The ‘Just When You Thought…’ event cards
at the Inspection Hostility Level has a Trader
take an ammo peg and add it to the Hostility
Tracker. Does the first ammo peg spent as part
of a ranged assault that round still get added to
the Hostility Tracker?
A: No, “only one ammo peg is placed in the
Hostility Tracker per round” [CSFB p.25].

The section below on damage is very detailed
and requires a whole page to explain clearly.

The First Born Campaign
Q: Which items do I remove from the supply at
the start of
the campaign in the First Born
Rulebook?
A: Remove only the 4 specific items shown on
page
3UA-value Dyson Rod,
10UA-value Dyson Rod and two of the four
4-piece set Artefact tokens. The other Dyson
Rods (two 5UA-value and one 3UA-value) and
Artefact tokens (both of the 2-piece set and the
two remaining pieces of the 4-piece set) should
be in their respective supplies as usual. If any
of the remaining 4-piece set Artefact tokens are
gained in the campaign, they must be kept in
your inventory (either a Trader’s or the ship’s
hold) for use in a later mission and cannot be
sold.

Q: Mission Briefing 4 - Hop to It (CSFB p.72)
states that you should include 3 Assist event
cards during setup, but the core set only comes
with 2. How many should I use?
A: You should use 2 Assist event cards, even if
you have access to other expansions [FB]

‘Reality Shift’) is drawn at the beginning of the
first Hostility Phase of the game and references
location, or
crew (such as swapping their
moving First Born towards their position) before
the first Trader Phase has begun and Traders
are all still inside their ship’s airlock?
A: Treat such an event card as having no part
of its text which can be resolved and shuffle it

Traders

Damage
Q: What is the priority, and interactions between, hit and damage prevention rules?
A: Assuming the attack is from a First Born, after the dice used in the attack have been rolled,
follow these steps for the character targeted by the attack and reduce the number of hits (the
symbols on the dice) and damage (any hits remaining, which remove 1 health peg each) in this
order:
1)

If the character holds any deflection items (such as an Ecco Orb) and suffers a ranged attack,
any hits rolled are applied to the attacker instead. This is not optional. If applicable, rotate or
discard the deflection item as appropriate. Other effects of the attack (such as the knowledge
die rolled by a First Born) apply to the defender as usual [BGG].
If the character suffers a ranged attack in partial cover - reduce the number of hits by 1 [CSFB
p.13, 25]
If the character is wearing physical or shield armour [CSFB p.23]:

2)

3)

a)
b)

If wearing only physical armour - reduce the number of hits by the armour value
If wearing only shield armour, reduce the number of hits by the shield value

i)

If any hits remain, the shield has become overloaded and will be rendered
inactive

c)

If wearing both physical and shield armour, use only the highest value available or, if
the values are equal, use the value of the shield armour and follow steps 3.b and 3.b.i

4)

If any Dyson equipment is held by the character AND they are neither “wearing or benefitting
from shield armour”, reduce the number of hits by 1 and place 1 energy counter on top of each
piece of Dyson equipment held [CSFB p.103].

a) Wearing shield armour which prevents Dyson equipment having an effect includes the

following items, even if they are inactive or have run out of shield pegs:

i)

ii)

Any yellow token or token marked “armour” on the back which has a shield
value and is placed in the trader’s character board [CSFB p.8]
Any utility equipment which grants shield pegs [UD p.2]

b)

If the number of energy counters on a piece of Dyson equipment exceeds its limit
number, it explodes and the holder immediately suffers an attack with a number of dice
equal to the limit number.

5)

If the character is wearing utility equipment with a blue shield icon (such as from the utility
dashboards expansion) and they have shield pegs remaining, the first point of damage dealt to
the character removes 1 shield peg instead of 1 health peg [UD p.2].

6) Any hits not yet reduced are dealt as damage, “actual wounds sustained” [CSFB p.7]; remove
1 health peg from the character’s dashboard for each damage sustained. If the last health peg
is removed, that character is defeated

In summary:

Deflection (if from First Born Energy),
(shield or physical),
cover, armour
shield pegs, wounds

OR, if without shield armour:

Deflection, cover, physical armour,
Dyson equipment, wounds

Deflection and Dyson equipment only affects
“First Born energy” [CSFB p.130], i.e. ranged
attacks from First Born characters or equipment
(green tokens). Other attacks (such as those
from a Rock Worm or a Trader using standard
equipemt) ignore the effects of such items.

if

This is the best explanation the authors can give.
However, according to this BGG post, a Customer
Services reply stated that Dyson equipment would
work alongside shield armour
the attack in
question overloaded the shield (presumably the
same logic applies to utility equipment which loses
its last shield peg during the attack). Such a
character is still wearing shield armour, even if no
value or pegs are in effect. We would recommend
using the ruling here, which follows the Rules As
Written
for
wearing/donning/removing armour
[CSFB p.28]
until a clarification from Battle Systems is made,
i.e. removing the "wearing or" clause from the
Dyson equipment rules on CSFB p.103.

Actions
Effortless Actions
Q: Is it an effortless action for a Trader to throw
a weapon, such as a grenade or knife?
A: Throwing as an effortless action requires
only that the item has a number in the burst
damage or
thrown damage statistic [CSFB
p.15, 30]. A thrown item does not need the
printed effortless action icon, and any such icon
printed is redundant.
[CSFB p. 29 (see the
'Example' box highlighted blue where Cassie
throws a Combat Knife as an effortless action),
CSFB LtP p.16 (where the Phase Loop and
First Born Dagger are described as being an
effortless action to throw), FB - see p.2 above]

Q: How many effortless actions can be taken in
one round?
A: Player Characters are able to take up to two
effortless actions per round plus however many
other actions they have from their Action
statistic or from having completed level 3 of
their career track (see the below question for a
discussion on actions): a Trader has 1
effortless action per round by default [CSFB p.
20]; the once per round use of skill pegs may
be used to spend 1 peg to make an additional
effortless action [CSFB p.31]; finally, you may
spend your actions to perform 1 effortless
action per action spent in this way [CSFB p.29].

this does not

Q: A Rock Work attacks a Trader for every
action it takes whilst in range, what about skills
or effortless actions?
A: A Rock Worm will only attack a character
that uses an action [as described in CSFB
include effortless
pp.20-28],
actions or skills, unless the skill states that it
confers an action. For example, while within
attack range of a Rock Worm a Trader could
use the Marksman skill at level 1 to “make a
ranged attack”
[CSFB p. 93] without being
attacked, but they would be attacked if they
used the Brutal Assault skill at level 1, “make a
close assault action…” [CSFB p.94]. See p.7
below for more on Rock Worms [BGG]

Actions
Q: How many actions can be taken in one
round?
A: There is no hard limit on the number of
potential actions a character may take in a

round. The current maximum number in the
game is (surprisingly!) 11 plus an effortless
action:
1. An action from a Trader’s character board
Action statistic
2. Another action, as above (most Traders
have an Action statistic of 2)
3. A character who has completed level 3 of the
career track is given one further action
4. Some character my spend a career point to
improve their Action statistic and gain an
additional action on their character board (once
they have improved their Health and Skill
statistics and completed the third row of their
care track)
5. Use one of the above actions to use an
‘action stim’
item, granting them 2 more
actions, a net gain of 1 action
6-9. Spending 3 skill pegs to use the Ambush
OR Brutal Assault skill at level 3 to gain 4 more
actions (Ambush confers a Move, Assault,
another Move and a Proximity Move, Brutal
Assault confers three Close Assault actions
and a Move. Note that while the Onslaught skill
at level 3 allows a character to make a large
number of close assault attacks, these attacks
are not considered separate actions).
10-11. A character with utility equipment gains
one free action each round per piece of utility
equipment, which can be used only to make an
assault action with that piece of equipment. If
they equip a Mounted Line Rifle and Mounted
Fusion Cannon they would gain two free
actions to make free ranged assaults with
these weapons [UD p.2].

Finally, a Trader can take an effortless action.

Assaults
Assaults and Actions
Q: Is there a difference between the phrases
‘ranged/close
‘ranged/close
attack’?
A: A ranged assault or close assault is one of
the actions a trader may take on their turn,
involving the selection of an appropriate item or
ability on a character board with which to make
the attack action, etc.. On the other hand, a
ranged attack or close attack is part of the
relevant assault action; the attack part involves
the gathering and rolling of certain dice and

105, GOTCHA]

While ranged or close assaults involve ranged
or close attacks, not all attacks come from an
assault action and can instead be generated by
other abilities (such as skills) or effects (such
as event cards). [BGG]

Ranged Assaults and Ammo
Q: Do all ranged attacks spend ammo pegs?
Do First Born equipment or attacks from class
skills, such as the Augmented, use ammo?
A: All ranged assault actions which use a piece
of standard equipment with a blue token or
utility equipment and having the relevant
crosshair and range icons require the Trader to
spend an ammo peg. As a general rule, all
ranged assaults and ranged attacks use ammo
pegs unless it is explicitly stated that they do
not. However, while this was the intent, not all
exceptions have been explicitly listed in the
rules. It should have been explicitly stated that
First Born equipment does not use ammo pegs,
nor do ranged attacks granted by class skills,
such as the Augmented Blast Skill. [BGG]

Drones
Activation
Q: How many actions do drones have? Can
they shoot twice?
A: Drones have 2 actions but you only go
through their unique AI Chart ONCE. [FAQ v1.2
p3]. They can move once, move once then
shoot once, or shoot once.
(This means it
cannot shoot twice, see FAQ v1.2 errata for
CSFB LtP p.14). They only become alerted in
the Patrol Hostility Level if they spot you when
they scan on their activation during the First
Born phase. This means a Trader can move
within Line of Sight of - but not adjacent to - a
Drone during e.g. the Trader phase or as the
result of an event card without alerting it.
[GOTCHA]

Q: What happens if a Drone cannot reach its
target safely, e.g. it is blocked by a Rock Worm,
exhaust or similar harmful effect?
A: Drones will ignore their AI Chart and instead
take move actions (up to two a turn) until they
reach (are on top of) the closest Patrol Point
with a safe and open route to it. When they
have reached the Patrol Point they will take an
action (if they have any remaining) to place
themselves on the Patrol Point closest to their
target. We recommend that if a Drone behaves
in this way and ends its turn on the closest
Patrol Point and is unable to take the ‘place
themselves’ action,

First Born
Target Priority
Q: Do First Born attack Rock Worms?
A: No, First Born will ignore Rock Worms and
avoid the squares around a Rock Worm that
they could be attacked from. CSFB p.35 states
no First Born will enter an area that “would
cause them harm (within 2 squares of [a] …

After the character has finished moving away,
the Rock Worm will get another attack, as per
its special rules (see below).

Q: A Rock Work attacks a Trader for every
action it takes whilst in range, what about skills
or effortless actions?
A: See above, p. 5.

Movement within their area
Q: Do Rock Worm attacks interrupt
/ stop
movement actions made from within their area?
A: No. The attack from a Rock Worm will
interrupt
the movement of a character who
enters into the attack range area of a Rock
Worm. After the attack is resolved, a character
can, if they wish, continue their movement and
pass
suffering
additional attacks. However, if a move action is
declared whilst within the attack range area of
a Rock Worm the Trader can complete their
move uninterrupted and the Rock Worm attack
will resolve only after the Trader’s move action
is resolved. The interaction of Rock Worm
attacks resolving only after the triggering action
has resolved is a general rule for Rock Worms.

through the area without

Rock Worm for example)” which rules out First
Born moving into the spaces around a Rock
Worm to engage it (although they will still move
near to or over Worm Hole marker tokens, if no
Worm is present). On CSFB p.41 it is stated
the
“The First Born are well aware of
that
worms’ presence. Rock Worms will not alert
Drones.” and p.36 states that Drones are
alerted “if there are any enemies within LoS
and medium range”, ipso facto Rock Worms
are not the enemies of First Born. Also, Lieges
and Drones have no way to damage the Rock
Worms, and the majority of knowledge die
effects do not apply (for example, Rock Worms
cannot be moved, except via their special event
cards replacing them on the map).

one point of damage in a single attack, how
many inserts should be removed?

A: One insert
dealt. For example, an awake and undamaged
True Born is attacked for 5 hits. The first 3 hits
are negated by its armour value of 3. The
remaining 2 hits cause 2 damage, which are
counted one point at a time; the first point of
damage removes the ‘woken’ number 1 insert
and is replaced by the ‘enraged’ number 2
insert; the second point of damage removes
the ‘enraged’ number 2 insert which is replaced
by the ‘wounded’ number 3 insert. When in
play, simply skip to the final insert. [CSFB p.38,

Discussion on Terrain, Line of Sight
and Movement
Doors and Walls
Doors, Doorways and Entrances are a special
kind of wall, and follow the rules for walls
unless otherwise stated; walls block line of
sight, prevent movement (if the whole square,
or space between squares, is blocked by a
wall) and the effects of blast weapons may not
pass through walls. Unlike regular walls,
drawing line of sight, movement and the effects
of blast weapons may pass through the map
squares
with
dashed/dotted lines as illustrated on the map
key (p. 45): a doorway has such a section 1
square wide either 1 square away from its left-
or rightmost edge, depending on orientation; a
secret door has such a section 1 square wide
in its centre; wide doorways and oval entrances
have such a section 2 squares wide in their
centre; and wide entrances have such a
section 6 squares wide in their centre. Oval and
wide entrance terrain pieces have areas (vines,
panelling) which overlap their dashed/dotted
section. These may obstruct line of sight but do
not
(see Standalone
Terrain, below).

prevent movement

sections marked

under

Standalone Terrain “at floor level”
Standalone terrain is any piece of terrain “at
floor level” (p.21), such as Exhaust Vents, Arcs,
Gate of Ry’sa (Gates of Ry’sa expansion),
ruined pillars (Ruined Catacombs expansion)
etc..
If any part of a square contains such
terrain, it is impassable and may not be entered
terrain not at floor
for movement. Note that
i.e. affixed to walls is ignored for the
level,
purposes of movement but
included for the
purposes of drawing line of sight. For example,
a vine or bulkhead added to a wall section from
above can provide partial cover, but
is not
considered as filling any of the squares on the
map for movement. This may cause some
issues when fitting a model neatly into a single
square overlapped by a wall, etc., see House
Rules below.

Diagonal Movement and Movement and
Terrain, Doorways, etc.
Diagonal movement is only possible between
two squares where the orthogonal route is also

possible, i.e. where both squares adjacent to
the two in question are empty of terrain. For
example:

A X
X B

You can move from A to B if, and only if, there
is no terrain making the X squares impassable.
If so, diagonal movement
is not allowed
through any doorway (etc.) which is placed
orthogonally because at
least one square
adjacent to the ‘door’ will include a wall section.
For example:

W O O W

If Ws are the wall section of a wide doorway
and Os are the dashed/dotted area, attempting
to move through an O square diagonally will
mean the W nearest to it blocks the orthogonal
route from the starting square to the O square.

However, if the above was placed diagonally
across the map then diagonal movement
becomes possible. This is because the wall
sections would not completely block the
square, and therefore do not make the square
impassable. CSFB p.21 has a diagram
example of diagonal movement through a wide
doorway which is placed diagonally across at
least 5 squares. This is an unusual
rules
interaction.

House Rules for Movement
Valand1l recommends that if less than 25% of
the square is available (e.g. because of an
angled wall section), a model may not be
placed there unless its base is large enough to
include at least 1 regular adjacent square (such
as a Guardian). If it is unclear, roll a die to
determine whether the model is considered as
occupying a) the square in question or b) any
adjacent square which is a valid end point of
the move action instead. Dricood recommends
following a simpler rule for any movement not
obviously handled by the rules: add one
additional point of movement
through such
terrain. This terrain includes, but is not limited
to, the vined-over sections of entrances, vines
which hang from down 'from the ceiling' and
scatter terrain rubble, etc..
