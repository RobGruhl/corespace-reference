## Quick Start

### The 30-Second Summary

You control a crew of traders exploring dangerous locations. Each round:
1. **Hostility rises** - Draw an event card
2. **You take actions** - Move, shoot, search
3. **Enemies react** - First Born/Purge attack
4. **NPCs act** - Other characters move
5. **Clean up** - Reset for next round

**Your goal:** Complete objectives and get your crew back to the ship alive.

### The 5-Minute Reference

**Movement:** 4" per Move action, max 11" per round
**Combat:** Roll dice shown on weapon, apply cover/armour modifiers
**Search:** Touch a crate to draw random equipment
**Defeated:** Lay figure on side, can be revived or dragged
**Hostility:** Rises each round, makes enemies more dangerous

**Key Rule:** Leaving base contact with enemies = they get a free attack

---

### Phase 1: Hostility Phase

**What Happens:**
The galaxy is a dangerous place, and things are about to get worse.

**Steps:**

1. **Add Hostility Peg**
   - Take 1 black peg
   - Place in first empty space on hostility tracker
   - (In multiplayer: Add 1 peg per 3 crews, round up)

2. **Draw Event Card**
   - Player with turn counter draws from deck
   - Look at current hostility level on tracker
   - Resolve effects for that level only

3. **Resolve Event**
   - **Assistance card (👍)?** Keep it secret, don't show others
   - **Can't fully resolve?** Do as much as possible
   - **Can't resolve at all?** Place NPC instead (if possible), shuffle card back, draw another

4. **Discard Card**
   - Place in faceup discard pile
   - If deck runs out, shuffle discards to make new deck

**What This Means:**
- Early game (Relaxed/Patrol): Minor events, few enemies
- Mid game (Inspection/Wake): More First Born arrive
- Late game (Threat Defence/Cleanse): Maximum danger, charged enemies

---

### Phase 2: Trader Phase (Your Turn!)

**This is your main phase.** Players take turns activating one trader at a time.

**Turn Order:**
1. Player with turn counter goes first
2. Proceed clockwise around table
3. Each player activates ONE trader
4. Continue until all traders have activated

**Activating a Trader:**

1. **Choose** an unactivated trader (no activation counter)
2. **Declare** which trader you're activating
3. **Take actions** based on trader's ACTION stat
4. **Place** activation counter on dashboard
5. **Pass** to next player

**Available Actions:**

Each trader has an ACTION stat (usually 2-4). You can take that many actions per turn.

#### Core Actions

**MOVE**
- Move up to 4" measured from base edge
- Can move through friendly characters
- Cannot move through enemies without permission
- **Max 11" total per round across all moves**
- ⚠️ Leaving base contact with enemy = attack of opportunity

**RANGED ASSAULT**
- Must have line of sight to target
- Cannot target enemies you're engaged with
- Choose a ranged weapon
- Roll dice based on range:
  - Short (0-5"): First number
  - Medium (5-13"): Second number
  - Long (13"+): Third number
- Partial cover reduces hits by 1
- Remove 1 ammo peg
- **First ranged assault each round:** Ammo peg goes to hostility tracker

**CLOSE ASSAULT**
- Only against enemies in base contact
- Choose weapon or fight unarmed
- Choose standard hit (first #) or heavy hit (second #)
- Roll that many dice
- Standard hits ignore 💥 results
- Heavy hits: 💥 may break weapon
- Cover doesn't apply, armour does

**SEARCH**
- Must be in base contact with cargo crate
- Must not be engaged with enemy
- Remove contents, keep secret
- Add any/all items to dashboard
- Discard unwanted items back to crate

**OR**

- Search a room (completely enclosed area)
- Must be no enemies in room
- Must not be engaged
- Draw random item from token pouch
- Each room: searchable once only (place counter)

**KNOCK BACK**
- Target in base contact
- Roll dice = unarmed combat value (or 1 if none)
- Each hit = push 1" directly away
- 3+ hits = target knocked prone
- Armour has no effect
- Rolling 💥 = you stumble, target can knock YOU back

**RELOAD**
- Must hold ammo token
- Must not be engaged
- Add ammo pegs shown on token
- Flip token or discard as indicated

**PERSUADE**
- Target NPC in base contact
- Must not be engaged
- Decide what to persuade them to do:
  - Trade an item
  - Join your crew
  - Mission-specific action
- Roll dice = your SKILL stat
- NPC's PERSUADE value reduces hits (like armour)
- If still score hit = success

**INTERACT**
- Mission-specific actions
- Usually requires contact with object
- Must not be engaged

#### Other Actions

**CLEAR JAM**
- Unjam a ranged weapon
- Must not be engaged
- Rotate weapon token 180°

**DON/REMOVE ARMOUR**
- Move armour between item tray and armour slot
- Must not be engaged

**STAND UP**
- Stand a prone figure upright
- They act normally after this

#### Effortless Actions

**You get ONE free effortless action per turn.**

These don't count toward your action limit:

- **Proximity Move:** Move up to 1" (still counts toward 11" max)
- **Use ✓ Item:** Use any item with effortless icon
- **Throw Item:** Throw item with 🎯 icon + damage number (✓ icon NOT required)
- **Pick Up/Drop Item:** In base contact
- **Give/Take/Swap Item:** With character in base contact

**Getting More Effortless Actions:**
- Spend 1 skill peg for 2nd effortless action
- This counts as your skill use for the turn

---

### Phase 3: First Born Phase

**The game fights back.** First Born activate according to AI rules.

**Part 1: Arrival**

1. **Check Hostility Level**
   - Look at current level's icons
   - At Relaxed: No First Born arrive

2. **Determine Arrivals**
   - Work down the list top to bottom
   - **Number shown:** That many arrive
   - **Die icon:** Roll the die
     - Black purge die = how many
     - Chance die with 💀 = Live One appears
   - When Hostility reaches CLEANSE: use "Charged" side of First Born board

3. **Place on Board**
   - Roll chance die for entry point
   - Place in contact with entry point
   - If no room, place as close as possible

**Important:** Rank 4+ First Born (Live One, Gatherer, Annihilator) appear ONCE per game only.

**Part 2: Activation**

First Born activate **highest rank first**, working down to rank 1.

**For Each First Born:**

1. **Choose Target**
   - Default: Closest non-First Born character in LoS, not in cover
   - If all in cover: Closest visible character
   - If none visible: Closest character (measure around walls)
   - **Exception - Assassins:** Always target Captains if visible
   - **Never target:** Defeated traders
   - **Target locks** for rest of turn (unless target defeated)

2. **Take Actions** (Use AI Chart)

Follow this priority each action:

```
Is target engaged with me?
  → YES: CLOSE ASSAULT
  → NO: Continue...

Is target in my line of sight?
  → NO: MOVE toward target
  → YES: Continue...

Do I have a shooting stat?
  → NO: MOVE toward target
  → YES: Continue...

Can I reach and attack target this turn?
  → YES: MOVE toward target
  → NO: Continue...

Have I already moved this turn?
  → NO: MOVE toward target
  → YES: Continue...

Is my shooting stat > close assault stat?
  → YES: RANGED ASSAULT
  → NO: MOVE toward target
```

**Special Rules:**
- First Born move as far as possible (unless reach target)
- Ranged assault has **unlimited range**
- Unaffected by 💥 results
- Knocked prone: must use first action to Stand Up

**Knowledge Die** (Drones & some First Born):
- Roll after determining hits
- Apply special effect based on result
- When using "Cleanse" side: may use multiple times

**Drone Special Rules:**
- Have 2 actions BUT consult AI Chart only ONCE per activation
- Possible combinations: Move+Move, Move+Shoot, or Shoot only
- **Cannot shoot twice** (even though they have 2 actions)
- Only alert in Patrol level when they spot you during their activation (not during Trader Phase)

---

### Phase 4: NPC Phase

**Other characters activate:** Game Hunters, Civilians, Gangers, etc.

**Activation Order:**
1. Galactic Corps
2. Security
3. Gangers
4. Civilians

Within each type: Highest rank first.

**Part 1: Arrival**

1. **Check hostility tracker** for NPC icons
2. **Roll chance die** for entry point
3. **Place NPC** in contact with entry point
4. **Finish activating** current type before placing next type

**Part 2: Activation**

Each NPC type has specific rules:

**Game Hunters:**
- Target priority: Beasts, First Born, then others
- Move toward target
- Attack when in range

**Civilians (if present):**
- Roll chance die each activation
- Follow die result: Move, Attack, Hide, Join, Trade, or Live One transformation

**General NPC Rules:**

- Can join crews if persuaded

**NPCs Joining Your Crew:**

- If defeated: Removed, cannot revive

---

### Phase 5: Assessment Phase

**Clean up and prepare for next round.**

**Steps:**

1. **Remove all activation counters**
2. **Resolve end-of-round effects**
   - Any abilities that trigger "at end of round"
   - Rotate timed equipment tokens
   - Check mission-specific conditions

## Core Mechanics

### Combat System Deep Dive

**Making an Attack (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Choose weapon** (or fight unarmed)
2. **Declare target** (must meet requirements)
3. **Roll combat dice:**
   - 1 blue die (always)
   - Additional red dice as shown
4. **Count ⚔️ symbols** = base hits
5. **Apply modifiers:**
   - Cover: -1 hit (if applicable)
   - Armour: Reduce by armour value
6. **Apply remaining hits as damage**
7. **Check for misfires:**
   - 2+ 💥 on ranged weapon = jammed (rotate 180°)
   - 2+ 💥 on close weapon (heavy hit) = broken (flip facedown)

**Armour Types:**

**Physical Armour 🛡️**
- Permanent effect while worn
- Reduces hits by value shown
- Applies every attack

**Shield Armour ⚡**
- Energy-based protection
- Works like physical armour BUT:
- If damage gets through = shield overloaded
- Flip token facedown = unusable rest of mission
- Recharges between missions

**Priority:** If you have both, use highest value. Ties = shield takes priority.

---

### Line of Sight & Cover

**Line of Sight (LoS):**

Draw a straight line from center of your base to any part of target.

**Can draw LoS if:**
- Not completely blocked by walls
- Not completely blocked by terrain as tall as target
- Not completely blocked by another character

**Characters are:**
- All same height for LoS purposes
- Entire area above base blocks LoS
- Can ignore terrain shorter than themselves if in base contact (applies to friendly crew too)

**Cover:**

Terrain/walls partially block LoS.

- **< 25% obscured:** No cover
- **25-90% obscured:** Partial cover (-1 hit)
- **> 90% obscured:** Full cover (cannot draw LoS)

**Cover doesn't apply to close assault.**

---

### Range

Measure with range ruler from edge of your base to edge of target's base.

- **Short:** 0-5"
- **Medium:** 5-13"
- **Long:** 13"+

Ranged weapons show three numbers: Short / Medium / Long dice to roll.

---

### Equipment Management

**Item Slots:**

Each trader has:
- **Item tray:** Hold weapons and items
- **Armour slot:** Only armoured items here provide protection
- **Ship's hold:** Store items between missions (campaign)

**During a Mission:**

- **Picking up:** Effortless action (or part of Search)
- **Dropping:** Effortless action
- **Swapping:** Effortless action (between traders in base contact)
- **Using:** Depends on item (action or effortless)
- **Don/Remove armour:** Costs 1 action

**Equipment Tokens:**

- **Blue:** Weapons (ranged/close)
- **Yellow:** Armour
- **Orange:** Special items
- **Purple:** Non-combat (money, ship parts)
- **Green:** Objectives

**Token backs show:** Purchase cost / Sell value

---

### Skills

**Using a Skill:**

1. **Select** which skill and what level (1-3)
2. **Remove** skill pegs = level chosen
3. **Execute** the skill effect
4. **Pegs stay removed** for rest of game

**Types:**

**Passive Skills:**
- Always active if you have the level
- Don't require spending pegs
- Example: Hard to Hit, Weapons Expert

**Reaction Skills:**
- Trigger outside your turn
- Respond to specific events
- Example: Reflexes, Counter Shot, Evade

**Active Skills:**
- Used during your turn
- Spend pegs to activate
- Example: Sure Shot, Onslaught, Assist

**Important:**
- You can use **ONE skill per round**
- OR spend a peg for 2nd effortless action
- Higher levels = more powerful but more expensive

---

### Defeated Characters

**When Health Reaches 0:**

1. **Lay miniature on its side**
2. **Place assistance counter** next to them
3. **Cannot be targeted** by enemies
4. **Cannot act** until revived

**Reviving:**

- Any trader in base contact can use healing item
- Can use defeated trader's items or your own
- Revived trader:
  - Restores health shown on item
  - Removes assistance counter
  - Left prone (must Stand Up)
  - Can activate normally this round (if haven't already)

**Grab a Leg (No healing items?):**

- Trader in base contact, target not engaged
- Spend 1 action to move up to 2" with defeated character
- OR two traders = move 4" together (both get reminder counter: -1 action next turn)

**Rob Them Blind:**

- Enemy traders can Search defeated trader like cargo crate
- Take items from item tray
- Discarded items left on floor

**In a Campaign:**

- Defeated traders left on board must be extracted after mission
- Roll chance die: 💀 = permanently dead
- Or attempt rescue mission
- Or use emergency teleport

---

## Common Scenarios

### "I want to shoot an enemy..."

**Check:**
1. ✅ Do you have a ranged weapon equipped?
2. ✅ Is the enemy in LoS?
3. ✅ Are you NOT engaged with the enemy?
4. ✅ Do you have ammo?

**If YES to all:**
1. Choose your ranged weapon
2. Measure range to target
3. Roll dice for that range (Short/Med/Long)
4. Apply cover modifier (-1 if in partial cover)
5. Apply armour modifier
6. Deal remaining hits as damage
7. Remove ammo peg (first shot each round goes to hostility tracker)

**If engaged with a DIFFERENT enemy:**
- You can shoot, but engaged enemy gets free attack on you first

**If target is engaged with your ally:**
- At short range: Pick your target
- At med/long range: Roll chance die after hits to see who you hit

---

### "I'm surrounded by enemies..."

**Your options:**

**Option 1: Fight Your Way Out**
- Use Close Assault to attack
- Use Knock Back to push enemies away
- Use skills like Onslaught or Burst Out

**Option 2: Stand Your Ground**
- Keep fighting in melee
- Hope allies can help

**Option 3: Tactical Retreat**
- Take a Move action
- ALL engaged enemies get free Close Assault on you
- May be worth it to reach objective or safety

**Option 4: Use Skills**
- Evade (reaction): Move when enemy engages you
- Fade to Black: Move action as reaction
- Combat Expert: Knock enemies prone then escape

**Pro Tip:** Don't get surrounded! Keep your back to walls.

---

### "My weapon jammed..."

**Ranged Weapon Jammed (2+ 💥 rolled):**

1. **Rotate token 180°** (shows jammed status)
2. **No damage dealt** this attack
3. **Use CLEAR JAM action** when not engaged
4. **Weapon works normally** after clearing

**Close Weapon Broken (2+ 💥 on heavy hit):**

1. **Flip token facedown**
2. **No damage dealt** this attack
3. **Cannot use weapon** rest of this mission
4. **Auto-repairs** between missions (campaign)

**Prevent Jams:**
- Use weapons with "Reliable" icon (🔧)
- Fight unarmed (no jam risk)
- Use First Born weapons (ignore 💥)

---

### "A teammate is down..."

**You have medical supplies:**
1. Move into base contact
2. Use healing item (costs action or effortless depending on item)
3. They revive prone with restored health
4. They can Stand Up and act (if they haven't activated this round)

**You DON'T have medical supplies:**

**Option A: Grab a Leg**
1. Move into base contact (not engaged yourself)
2. Spend 1 action to drag them 2" toward ship
3. Repeat until they reach ship airlock

**Option B: Get Help**
- Have another trader bring you medical supplies
- Trade items (effortless action)
- Then revive

**Option C: Leave Them**
- They'll need extraction after mission
- Roll on extraction table (chance of death)
- Or run a rescue mission

**In Combat:**
- Enemies WON'T target defeated traders
- But enemies CAN rob them
- Protect your fallen!

---

### "How do I complete objectives?"

**Most missions require:**

1. **Search for objective** (green token in crates)
2. **Pick up objective** (SEARCH action)
3. **Carry objective** to ship (takes up item slot)
4. **Return to airlock** (MOVE to board edge)
5. **Exit game** (considered safe)

**Tips:**

- Designate a "runner" with high movement
- Give them mobility skills (Accelerate, light armour)
- Have others provide covering fire
- Don't wait for everyone - mission ends when all traders off board OR all defeated
- You can sabotage objectives if needed

**Mission ends when:**
- All traders back on ships, OR
- All traders defeated

**Winning:**
- Complete primary objective = winner
- If not completed: most traders alive wins
- Still tied: most valuable equipment wins

---

### "When do I use skills?"

**During Your Turn:**
- Most active skills
- Spend pegs equal to level
- Execute immediately
- Example: "I use Sure Shot level 2 to shoot without penalty"

**Outside Your Turn (Reactions):**
- Triggered by specific events
- Check skill description for trigger
- Can use even after you've activated this round
- Example: "Enemy shoots me → I use Reflexes to ignore hits"

**Always On (Passive):**
- No peg cost
- Works if you have the level
- Example: "I have Walk it Off 1, so I restore 1 health"

**Remember:**
- ONE skill use per round (active or reaction)
- OR spend a peg for 2nd effortless action instead
- Choose wisely!

---

### "What's the hostility tracker?"

**Think of it as a doom clock.**

- Each round: +1 peg
- More pegs = higher hostility level
- Higher level = more/stronger enemies + worse events

**Levels:**

1. **Relaxed** (0-4 pegs): Minor events, no First Born
2. **Patrol** (5-9): Small First Born arrive
3. **Inspection** (10-14): More First Born, stronger events
4. **Wake Protocols** (15-19): Heavy resistance
5. **Threat Defence** (20-24): Serious danger
6. **CLEANSE** (25+): First Born use "Charged" stats, maximum threat

**What increases it:**
- Every round (+1 automatic)
- First ranged shot each round (+1 from ammo peg)
- Some event cards
- Some terrain effects

**What decreases it:**
- Very rare!
- Some tech skills (Regulate)
- Usually can't decrease it

**Strategy:**
- Work fast early game
- Plan your escape before CLEANSE
- First shot each round costs hostility - coordinate who shoots

---

### "Can I go back for loot?"

**Short answer:** Only if you haven't left the board.

**Once you return to your ship and exit:**
- You're out of the game
- Cannot return to board
- Safe from further harm

**Strategy:**

**Option A: Greed is Good**
- Keep searching as long as possible
- Risk: Hostility keeps rising
- Risk: May get defeated and lose everything

**Option B: Safe and Sound**
- Grab objective and run
- Less loot but mission success
- All traders survive

**Option C: Split the Party**
- Some traders run objective to ship
- Others keep looting
- Coordinate extraction timing

**Remember:**
- Dead traders = lost equipment
- Defeated traders = might extract safely
- Mission failure = usually can keep equipment found

**In campaigns:** Equipment persists between missions, so early loot = long-term advantage.
