   - Additional red dice as shown
2. Count ‚öîÔ∏è symbols = hits
3. Apply modifiers in order:
   - Cover (ranged only): -1 hit if partial cover
   - Armour: Reduce by armour value
   - Other modifiers: As specified
4. Remaining hits = damage
5. Check misfires: 2+ üí• = weapon jams/breaks

**Damage Application:**

**Traders:**
- Lose 1 Health peg per hit
- If Health reaches 0: Defeated (lay on side, place assistance counter)
