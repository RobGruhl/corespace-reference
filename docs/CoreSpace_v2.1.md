SETUP

Choose a mission. Missions can be played as one-offs, or as a
continuous narrative, keeping track of your crew’s performance.

Lay out the gaming mat(s) and terrain. Take note of any specific
items to be placed in the random draw for cargo crate items. Unless
stated otherwise, the edge of the playing area is considered a wall
for all rules purposes.

Randomly choose the number of large equipment tokens and rare
 large tokens specified, shuffle them, and randomly place them
in the large crates. Do the same for the number of small equipment
tokens and rare
randomly place them in the small and large crates as specified.
Then place the rest of the normal small equipment tokens in the
bag. Players then take it in turns to randomly place the cargo crates
on the board in the map positions given.

 large tokens specified, shuffle them, and

Choose which NPCs will be used, and place their miniatures and
character boards near the board. Place the purge board and purge
miniatures near the board.

Shuffle together the event cards used in the mission (matching
the given icons) and any appropriate NPC type cards, and place
the deck facedown near the board. Include the event cards for any
NPCs being used, and include the purge reinforcement cards when
you have a second set of purge miniatures. If there are 4 or more
crews in play, always use the extra set of purge miniatures and the
purge reinforcement cards.

Place the entry points around the board as specified.

With 2 players, toss the turn counter to see who deploys their crew
first. With more than 2 players, roll the white chance die with the
highest roller going first (reroll ties). The winning player can choose
any airlock door to be their starting point. The other players, in
clockwise order, then choose their starting points.In a campaign,
the winner of the previous game can choose first without flipping
the coin or rolling the die.

Each player selects their crew and places their dashboards in
front of them with their trader and class boards in place. On the
trader board, spaces filled with an inner circle indicate the trader’s
default stats: fill these in at the start of the game. The rest are
potential spaces and can be filled to add points to the character’s
stats. A character cannot exceed their potential, but may drop
below their default.

Each player places their ship board, airlock side up, in line with
their chosen airlock location, and places their miniatures on it.

Place health (green) and skill (purple) pegs equal to your
characters’ starting statistics into your dashboards, then add a full
amount of ammo (yellow) pegs. Unless playing a rescue mission,
pegs are always set to their current values at the start of a game.

The player that deployed last takes the turn counter and goes first.

The chance die can be used to roll a random number, or a direction
for scatter. In both cases ignore the main icon. A scattering object
scatters a number of inches equal to the number and in a direction
indicated by the arrow; if it hits a wall, another model, or an
obstruction, it stops.

ORDER OF PLAY

1. HOSTILITY PHASE

Add 1 black peg into the first empty space on the hostility tracker.
In multiplayer games, add 1 peg for every 3 crews (round up).

The player with the turn counter draws an event card. Resolve
all the effects detailed for the current hostility level, then place
the card in a faceup discard pile. If the deck runs out, shuffle the
discards to make a new deck.

If you draw an assistance card       , do not show it to the other
players; keep the card for later use.

If a card allows multiple players to make an action, turn counter
holder goes first, proceeding clockwise. If there is no target for a
rule, it has no effect. If only part of the text can be resolved, resolve
as much as possible. If no part of the text can be resolved, ignore
it. If there is an icon at the end of the paragraph, place a new NPC
instead, if possible. Whether an NPC is placed or not, shuffle the
unresolved card back into the deck and draw another.

2. TRADER PHASE

Starting with the player with the turn counter and
proceeding clockwise, players take turns to activate their
traders.

Each player activates 1 character at a time until all traders have
been activated, at which time move on to the next phase. When
it is your turn to activate a trader, choose one of your traders that
has not been marked with an activation counter to activate, take
actions with the trader, then place an activation counter on
trader’s dashboard to indicate that they cannot act again this
round. Play passes to the next player clockwise.

the

A trader’s ACTION statistic shows how many actions they can take
in a turn. You can choose to use all, some, or none of them when
activating your character.

The most common actions are MOVE, RANGED ASSAULT, CLOSE
ASSAULT, KNOCK BACK, SEARCH, RELOAD, PERSUADE, and
INTERACT. Unless specified, there is no limit to the number of times
an action can be taken, or in what order they can be taken in.

You can also take effortless actions. These do not count towards
your action limit, but you can only take 1 per turn.

Prone characters cannot take do anything other than take a STAND
UP action, after which they can take actions normally.Defeated
characters cannot take any actions at all until they have been
revived by another character.

3. PURGE PHASE

1. Arrival
Each hostility level has icons indicating the characters that could
potentially arrive in this phase. At RELAXED level, no purge arrive.

Start at the top of the level’s list, and work down. If a purge icon
is followed by a number, that many arrive. If it is followed by a die
icon, roll that die: the black purge die shows how many arrive, the
chance die indicates a Live One appears if you roll

 .

When the level reaches PURGE!, the number of purge arriving
will be the same as in KILL ME, but from now on all purge use the
increased statistics on the CHARGED side of the purge board.

Roll the chance die separately for each type of purge arriving and
place them on the board in contact with the corresponding entry
point counter. If there is no room because the area is blocked by
other models, place them as close as possible.

If purge need to be placed outside of the purge phase, place them
onto the board at that entry point and then activate them in the
purge phase as normal.

Purge of rank 4 and above (Live Ones, Gatherers and Annihilators)
only appear once per game. Once one has been placed, do not roll
for that purge type again for the rest of the game, and any other
rule that would generate one is ignored. Once the character has
been defeated, it will not return.

If using the purge reinforcement cards, a second purge of each
type can appear, but only once the hostility reaches PURGE!

In a 2 player game only use the core set purge miniatures (5
Harvesters, 2 Devastators, 1 Assassin, and 1 Live One). If there
are none remaining of a type, use the next lowest ranked purge
character available. If there are no Harvesters left and you need to
spawn more, none will arrive until some have been defeated.

2. Activation
All purge on the board now activate, starting with the highest
ranked purge character on the board, followed by the next highest
rank, and so on down to the rank 1 Harvesters.

If there are multiple purge of the same rank on the board, the player
with the turn counter chooses the order in which they activate.

The purge are controlled by the game, but should be moved and
rolled for by the player with the turn counter, unless that player’s
crew is being attacked, in which case another player should roll.

The purge and other NPCs take actions based on the following AI
sequence. Each purge character continues to take actions from
this list until they have none left to use.

TARGETS
Before activating, each purge character chooses a target.

1.  By default the target is the closest non-purge character within

LoS and not in cover.

2.  If all visible characters are in cover, the target is the closest.

3.  If there are no visible characters, the target is the closest

non-purge character. Measure the shortest possible distance
between the purge and the potential targets, moving around
terrain and through doors as necessary.

4.  The one exception to this rule is for purge Assassins. If they
can see a trader Captain, it will be their target even if it isn’t
the closest character, and they will move around or over other
targets to reach it. This includes leaving base contact with
another enemy and provoking an attack of opportunity. If an
Assassin cannot see a Captain, they follow the normal rules.

5.  Defeated traders are never targeted.

Once a target has been chosen, it remains locked for the rest of
that character’s turn. This applies even if a closer target comes into
view part-way through a move. The target is only reassessed mid-
turn if the original target is defeated. Otherwise it will be reassessed
next time that character activates.

ACTIONS
The purge make MOVE and ASSAULT actions in the same way as
traders. Each time they make an action, they prioritise the action
that causes the most harm possible, using the AI action chart.

Purge that take a MOVE action move as far as possible unless they
move into base contact with the target, when they stop.

RANGED ASSAULT actions by the purge have unlimited range, but
follow the normal rules for shooting at engaged characters.

Purge are unaffected by

 results unless stated otherwise.

Purge that have been knocked prone must use their first action to
STAND UP, before making the rest of their activation as normal.

4. NPC PHASE

All other NPCs controlled by the game act, using the statistics on
their boards. They may carry items, but cannot use them.

NPCs are always activated in the same order: Galactic Corps,
Security, Gangers, and finally Civilians. Gangers and the Galactic
Corps use the number of actions on their board and the AI chart.
Civilians and Security roll their respective die, once only. However if
a civilian has joined a crew, or security has been commandeered by
the Corps, they use the number of actions on their board.

For each type of NPC activated, the highest ranked one on the
board activates first, followed by the next highest rank, and so
on. If there are multiple NPCs of the same rank on the board,
the player with the turn counter chooses the order in which they
activate.

NPCs are controlled by the game, but should be moved and rolled
for by the player with the turn counter, unless that player’s crew is
being attacked, in which case another player should roll.

NPCs that have been knocked prone must use their first action to
STAND UP, before making the rest of their activation as normal.
If an NPC’s turn is determined by a die roll instead of by taking
actions, STAND UP replaces the die roll and they will do nothing
further this round.

1. Arrival
NPCs appear as instructed. When you activate a NPC type, first
check the hostility tracker to see if any will be automatically
spawned, as indicated by their icon.

NPCs arrive at a random location around the board, determined by
the chance die in the same way as for the purge. If there are NPCs
of multiple ranks arriving at the same time, place the lowest rank
available.

Place NPCs on the board in contact with their entry point. If there is
no room because the area is blocked by other models, place them
as close as possible.

If there are multiple NPC types shown on the hostility tracker,
do not place the next type until you have finished activating the
current one. If you are required to place an NPC and there are no
more available, none are placed.

2. Activation
Once the NPCs are all on the board, activate them as normal.

TARGETS
Before activating, each NPC chooses a target:

Each type of NPC has a target priority list that should be used
alongside the following steps.

1.  If the NPC is in base contact with any enemies, their target will

be the highest priority of the characters in contact that they can
damage. If they cannot damage any of the engaged enemies,
they will attack the highest priority target with no effect.

2.  If the NPC has no enemies in base contact, but there are

enemies in LoS, the target is the highest priority of those visible.

  •  If there are multiple enemies of the same priority, the target

  will be the closest of those not in cover.

  •  If all are in cover, the target will be the closest.

3.  If an NPC needs to shoot its chosen target but is unable to

damage it, it will instead target the next highest priority enemy
in LoS. If there are no other enemies in LoS, it will still attack the
original target but with no effect.

4.  If there are no enemies in LoS, the target will instead be the

closest, highest priority target available. Measure the shortest
possible distance between the NPC and the enemies, moving
around terrain and through doors as necessary.

5.  Defeated traders are never targeted.

NPCs that need to move past other enemy characters to reach their
target or fulfil their designated action must do so without entering
base contact. If they cannot, they will instead enter base contact
with the character that they could not get past, and stop.

NPCs that take a MOVE action always move as far as possible
unless they move into base contact with the target, at which point
they will stop.

NPCs can fire at up to medium range, and follow the normal rules
for shooting at engaged characters.

NPCs are unaffected by

 results unless stated otherwise.

5. ASSESSMENT PHASE

Remove all activation counters.

Any other effects that state they happen ‘at the end of the round’
happen now.

Pass the turn counter to the next player clockwise around the table;
they will be in control for the following round.

ACTIONS

Move
A character taking a MOVE action can move up to 4". No matter
how many actions you move, and no matter your abilities, you can
never voluntarily move more than 11" in one round (you may still be
KNOCKED BACK by an enemy or moved involuntarily by an effect).

Measure movement using the range ruler, from the edge of the
figure’s base. You can move in any direction, but not through or
over terrain unless specified otherwise. You can move through other
friendly characters, but not through enemies without permission
(enemy NPCs never give permission).

In the basic game, all doors are opened and unlocked and all
windows are open (but cannot be moved through, other than the
purge or those with the scramble ability).

ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY
If you leave base contact with 1 or more enemies, either at the start
of, or during, your MOVE, all standing, engaged enemies can make
a free CLOSE ASSAULT action against you, regardless of whether
they have activated this turn. This action is resolved immediately
and does not use any of their actions for the turn.

ENTERING AND LEAVING THE SHIP
Traders start the game in their airlock. Your first action must be a
MOVE action to enter the board, measured from the airlock door.
Traders wishing to return to their ship can do so with a MOVE,
measured to the airlock door at the board edge. Once you have
left the board, you are out of the game and cannot return. Enemy
traders and NPCs may not enter a player’s ship without permission.

Assault
An ASSAULT action allows one character to attack another.

RANGED ASSAULT attacks are made with a ballistic,
chemical or energy weapon, fired at a distance
against targets within LoS and range. They cannot

be made against targets engaged with you. If you are engaged with
one or more enemies while making a ranged attack, those enemies
may make an attack of opportunity against you.

Choose one of your ranged weapons to attack with, and roll a
number of dice based on the range between you and the target.
The numbers in the icon are for short, medium, and long range
respectively. Partial cover reduces the number of hits on a target by
1. Resolve this modifier before any other modifiers such as armour.

Making a ranged attack reduces your ammo: remove an ammo peg
from your dashboard.

After the first RANGED ASSAULT action made by a trader in each
round, place the peg in the hostility tracker instead of discarding
it. Only 1 ammo peg is so placed per round.

If you want to shoot at an enemy engaged with another character,
at short range you can freely pick your target, but at medium or
long range, after rolling to hit, roll the chance die to determine
which of the combatants you have hit. Modifiers are worked out
based on the actual target hit.

RANGED ASSAULT actions taken by the purge have unlimited range.
All other NPCs can fire at up to medium range. They both follow the
normal rules for shooting at engaged characters.

CLOSE ASSAULT attacks are made with fists or a
combat weapon and can only be made against
enemies engaged with (in base contact) with you.
You may either fight unarmed (if possible) or choose one of your
close assault weapons to attack with. Then choose whether to
make a standard hit (first number) or a heavy hit (second number),
and roll the number of dice shown.

Standard hits ignore
breaking the weapon and

 results. Heavy hits have a chance of
 results apply as normal.

Cover does not apply to close assault attacks, but armour applies
as normal.

RESOLVING AN ASSAULT
Both types of attack are made in the same way:

•   Roll combat dice for the weapon as shown on its token

(or on your character profile if fighting unarmed). The blue die
is always rolled; if additional dice are required, also roll red dice.
The number of

 rolled are hits.

•   Apply any applicable modifiers to the roll such as cover or

armour, altering the number of hits scored. Special rules and
skills may apply further modifiers.

•   Any remaining hits cause damage.

If targeting a trader, reduce the target’s health by 1 for each point
of damage. If health reaches 0 the trader is defeated – lay the
figure on its side. They will remain there until moved or revived.

If targeting an NPC, unless stated otherwise the NPC is instantly
defeated and removed from play if they take damage. Any items
they were carrying are left on the ground where they fell.

Attacks made as a result of rules or cards specify the number of
dice to roll rather than referring to a character or weapon. Unless
stated otherwise, such attacks do not have an origin and therefore
cover modifiers do not apply.

MISFIRES
If 2 or more
breaks and no damage is caused.

 are rolled on the combat dice, the weapon jams or

Ranged weapons are jammed: Rotate the token 180°. Clearing a
jammed ranged weapon costs 1 action.

Close assault weapons and thrown weapons are broken: Flip the
token facedown. Broken weapons cannot be used again this game,
but are repaired automatically afterwards if playing a campaign.

If you are fighting unarmed, or your weapon has a

 icon,

 results have no effect.

ARMOUR
Hits sustained in an attack can be reduced by armour.

Physical armour has a permanent affect while worn,
reducing the number of hits suffered by the physical armour

value given. This happens each time the wearer is attacked.

Shield armour is energy-based, and if beaten is inactive for
the rest of the game. If a character with shield armour takes

hits up to and including the shield armour value, the attack is
resolved just like physical armour above.

However, if enough hits get through to damage the wearer, the
shield has been overloaded and cannot be used for the rest of the
mission: flip the token facedown. It will recharge between missions
in a campaign.

Armour with an unarmed combat icon can be used in a close
assault attack. These icons do not stack.

If a character has both physical and shield armour at the same
time, use the highest value available. If the values are equal, the
shield armour takes priority.

THROWING ITEMS

Items that can be thrown have this icon and require LoS to
the target. Most can only be thrown at short range; an M or L

next to the icon indicates it can be thrown at a longer range.

Resolve throwing a close assault weapon like a ranged attack, using
the number of dice inside the icon. Cover, armour and any other
modifiers apply as normal. Remove the thrown weapon from your
dashboard and place it on the floor adjacent to the target; it can be
picked up again from the floor like any other token.

BLAST WEAPONS
Blast weapons affect the target and anyone within 2". They do not
have to target a character; the attack resolves even if they hit a
point on the floor, and they can be aimed at such a point. When
firing or throwing a blast weapon, choose a target point or character
within range and LoS, and then roll the blue combat die:

•   Any number of hits: You have hit your target.

•   Blank/no hits: Miss; the blast origin is 1" away from your target

in a direction of your choice.

•

: Serious miss; the blast origin is up to 2" away from your
target in a direction of the target player’s choice (or the player
with the turn counter if the target was an NPC).

If there is intervening terrain between the shooter and the target,
reduce the number of hits rolled by 1.

Now roll a number of combat dice for every character hit by the
blast: use the large number for the target, the top right number for
those at least partially within 1" of the target point, and the bottom
right number for those more than 1" away but at least partially
within 2" of the target point.

Blast effects cannot pass through walls, but do pass through
windows and across other terrain. Characters on the other side of
the terrain hit by the blast benefit from a cover modifier as usual.

DEFEATING THE LIVE ONE
The first trader to defeat a Live One in a mission takes the Live One
kill point counter. This counter is exchanged in the advancement
phase after the game.

Knock back
To KNOCK BACK another character in base contact, roll dice equal
to your unarmed combat value, if you have one, or 1 die if you do
not. For each hit scored, the defending model is pushed 1 inch
directly away from the attacker. Armour has no effect.

You can follow up to remain in base contact with the defender if
you wish, and have not already moved your maximum distance this
round. None of these moves attract attacks of opportunity.

If you score 3 or more hits, the defender is knocked prone.

If the space directly behind the defender is blocked by other
characters or terrain, they are pushed in the closest possible
direction instead. If there is no space to push an opponent back,
they do not move.

If you roll any
, you stumble: the action is not resolved, and the
opposing model can immediately make a free KNOCK BACK action
against you. If they also roll a

, there is no effect.

 characters use the number within the icon like armour

Massive
against knock backs, reducing the number of hits. They also add
this many automatic hits to their own KNOCK BACK attempts.

Search
You may search any cargo crate you are in base contact with,
as long as you are are not engaged with an enemy. Remove the
contents, keeping the tokens secret from the other players. You can
add any or all of the contents to your character’s dashboard.

Place any remaining items, along with any of your character’s items
that you no longer want or have room for, back into the cargo crate
(if it is a small crate and you are discarding a large item, place it
on the floor in base contact with your character). Crates can be
searched any number of times in a game.

You may also make a general search of the room you are in, if you
are not engaged with an enemy and there are none in the room (a
room is defined as an area completely surrounded by either walls or
the edges of the board, ignoring doors and windows).

Take a random item from the token pouch, and add it to your
dashboard if you wish. If you don’t want it, or want to swap it with
an item you have, place the discarded item on the floor in base
contact with your character.

Each room can only be searched once per mission; place a search
counter in the room as a reminder that it cannot be searched again.
Players may agree to separate very large rooms or long corridors
into multiple areas that can each be searched separately.

You can’t use an item without putting it in your inventory first.

Persuade
You can try to persuade an NPC you are in base contact with,
as long as you are not engaged with an enemy. NPCs can be
persuaded to:

Trade an item: If they are carrying an item you may swap it for one
of your own (small items only). If they are not carrying an item you
may draw one at random from the token pouch, and swap that
instead. If you don’t want the item drawn, leave it in the NPC’s item
slot and do not make a trade.

Join your crew: If successful and allowed by the mission, the NPC
will acting as one of your crew members for the remainder of the
mission. They can be activated in the current round.

Make a mission-specific action: Some missions will list extra things
that you can persuade an NPC to do.

Decide what you are persuading a NPC to do before rolling.
Roll a number of combat dice equal to your character’s skill

statistic (the value on your character board, not the remaining
number of pegs). The NPC’s PERSUADE value works like armour,
modifying your roll. If your roll still scores a hit, the action is
successful.

Reload
Reloading can only be done if you are holding an ammo token and
are not engaged with an enemy.

Add the number of ammo pegs listed on the token to your
dashboard, up to the maximum. Then flip

 the token, or discard

 it to the token bag, as indicated.

Interact
Some missions specify additional actions. Unless stated otherwise,
you must be in contact with an object and unengaged in order to
interact with it.

Other Actions
CLEAR JAM
Unjams a ranged weapon; this can only be done when not engaged
with an enemy.

DON/REMOVE ARMOUR
When armour is picked up, place it in your item tray. Make this
action to move or swap an armour token from the tray to the
armour slot or vice versa. This can only be done when not engaged
with an enemy.

STAND UP
Stand a prone figure upright. They act normally from then on.

Effortless actions
Effortless actions are free, do not count as one of your actions for
the turn, and can be taken in addition to regular actions.

You may only make 1 free effortless actions per turn. If you have
already made one, subsequent effortless actions count towards
your action limit. Unless stated otherwise, effortless actions can
only be made before or after other actions.

Alternatively, spend a skill peg to use a second free effortless
action, but this counts as your skill use for that turn.

Effortless actions include MAKING A PROXIMITY MOVE, USING
ANY ITEM MARKED WITH
DROPPING OR SWAPPING AN ITEM in base contact, GIVING, TAKING
OR SWAPPING AN ITEM with another character in base contact (if
the other player allows it). There may be further effortless actions
available in some missions or with certain skills.

, THROWING AN ITEM, PICKING UP,

A PROXIMITY MOVE allows a character to move up to 1", following
normal movement rules (you still may not move further than 11"
per round).

Items with
you may have to discard

 can be used effortlessly. Once the action is complete
 the token to the token bag.

LINE OF SIGHT, RANGE & COVER

LINE OF SIGHT
To draw LoS, draw a straight line from the centre of your character’s
base to any part of the target character. If you cannot do so without
being completely obstructed by another character, wall, or a piece
of terrain at least as tall as the target, LoS cannot be drawn.

All characters are considered to be the same height for LoS
purposes (unless they are massive
their base blocks LoS, regardless of their pose.

) and the entire area above

If you can only draw a line to part of the target, or the line is
obstructed by a piece of terrain shorter than the target (such as a
crate), check the cover rules.

Characters can ignore pieces of terrain shorter than themselves
if they are in base contact. This also applies to other members of
their crew in base contact.

RANGE
Measure range using the range ruler, from the edge of the shooting
character’s base to the edge of the target’s base.

Short range is up to 5 inches.
Medium range is from 5–13 inches.
Long range is 13 inches or more.

COVER
A target is in cover if terrain and walls partially block LoS, but
enough of the target is visible for a shot to be taken.

If 25% of the target or less is obstructed, LoS can be drawn as
normal and no further rules apply.

If between 25% and 90% of the target is obstructed, this is partial
cover. LoS can be drawn, but additional rules may apply.

If 90% or more of a target is obstructed, they are in full cover: LoS
cannot be drawn at all.

SKILLS

Each skill is represented by a coloured icon. On a trader’s class
board, mark the spaces around each icon to record proficiency
with that skill, from level 1 to level 3. A skill on a trader board has its
level marked. All skills have a maximum level of 3.

Once per round, a trader can spend skill pegs to use one of
their skills. Some skills are used during other actions, and some
grant actions themselves – these are done before or after regular
actions, but not during, and do not count as one of your actions
for the turn.

To use a skill, you must:

1.  Select which skill you want to use and at which level.

2.  Remove a number of skill pegs from your dashboard equal to the

skill’s level (these stay removed for the rest of the game).

3.  Carry out the action listed in the skill section for that skill.

Unless otherwise noted in the skill’s description, skills must be
used during a character’s turn.

If a skill contradicts anything in the core rules, the skill’s
description takes precedence.

Skill pegs can also be spent on effortless actions. This counts
towards the once per round limit, and you will not be able to use
any other skills until the following round.

PASSIVE SKILLS
Once a character has the relevant level of a passive skill, or above,
the rule is always in effect, and does not require any skill pegs to
use. Passive skills can still be used if a character has no skill pegs
remaining.

This trigger condition, or any action currently being taken (for
example an opponent making an attack) must be fully resolved
before your skill is used. The skill must then be used immediately,
before regular play resumes where it left off.

Reaction skills can be used even if your character has already been
activated this round.

DUPLICATE SKILLS
If you have a duplicate of a skill, add the levels together.

Sometimes these skills might be in your armour slot, and putting
armour on may reduce the level of a skill available to a character,
even if they also had it on their class board.

EQUIPMENT

Weapons (blue): These are held in your item tray and used to make
ASSAULT actions.

Armour (yellow): Can be held in your item tray, but their rules only
apply when in the armour slot.

Special items (orange): Any other equipment.

Non-combat equipment (purple): Items not used during the game
(eg, money or ship parts), used when trading and maintaining your
ship when the mission is over. Place them in your item tray.

Objectives (green): These tokens are only used where specified
in missions, to represent a vital asset that the crews are trying to
retrieve. Usually a trader has to carry this off of the board to win.

On the back of each equipment token is the cost of the item, used
when trading in a campaign.

DEFEATED CHARACTERS

Lay a defeated trader miniature on its side, and place an
assistance counter next to them to remind you that they
are not just prone.

Unless stated otherwise, defeated traders can never be targeted by
an enemy or selected when a rule calls for a random trader.

REVIVING CHARACTERS
Items or skills that restore health can be used to revive a defeated
trader. They must be used by another trader in base contact, who
can take the item from their own supplies, or from the defeated
trader’s item tray.

A revived trader restores the specified amount of health and
removes the assistance counter. They are left prone, but can
activate as normal in the current round, if they haven’t already.

GRAB A LEG
If the crew don’t have any medical supplies, defeated characters
can be carried or dragged back to their ships.

As long as the defeated character is not in contact with an enemy,
a trader in contact with a defeated character can spend an action
to move up to 2", taking the defeated character with them.

If another trader from your crew is in contact with the defeated
character, you may move both traders and the defeated character
up to 4" instead as a single action. Both are still bound by the 11"
maximum. Place a reminder counter next to the other character
that moved, as they will take 1 fewer action in their next turn.

ROB THEM BLIND
Other traders in contact with the defeated trader can make a
SEARCH action as if the trader were a cargo crate, taking any items
they want from the character’s item tray.

Leave any discarded items next to the defeated trader.

MISSIONS

Missions may specify that certain types of NPCs must be used. The
purge and the civilians from the core set are always used; otherwise
the players decide which NPCs are used in a game.

Players can come to any agreement for what it may be worth to
help one another. If you have made a deal and are playing co-
operatively, your crews are no longer enemies and can ignore rules
that reference them, such as attacks of opportunity. There is no
restriction on backstabbing and reneging on a deal once it’s done.

ENDING A MISSION
Unless specified otherwise, a mission ends immediately when all
traders are either defeated or are back on board their ships. If an
entire crew was defeated, that player automatically loses.

Otherwise, in a one-off game, the player(s) that completed the
primary objective are the winner(s). If it was not completed, the
winner is the player with the most traders still alive. On a tie, add
up the sale price (second number on the back) of all of your crew’s
equipment tokens: the winner is the player with the most money.

Unless stated otherwise, objectives do not have to be completed to
finish a game, and you can also sabotage a mission by destroying
the objective.

SELECTING A CREW

Traders have a points value in the corner of their boards. Players
either use a pre-built crew, or decide on a crew points limit (eg,
180) and buy their crew. You must select 1 captain and you may
select up to 6 crew. You can choose from any traders available,
including civilians and gangers (use the reverse side of the boards).

For each trader in your crew, select any class board from those
available. Slot it into your dashboard with your trader board, and
allocate the trader’s career points to the skills, up to the default
value. Crews should have at least 1 trader with the tech class.

Rookie crews do not start with any career advancements, use their
starting statistics, and, taking turns to choose, can be equipped
from the range of 0 cost items. Each trader may take up to: a single
ranged weapon, a single close combat weapon, and a single medi-
stim (maximum 2 medi-stims per crew).

Experienced crews can be used even if you’re not playing a
campaign. Select your traders as normal, then players decide on a
starting career level. Advance traders that many times. Players then
agree on a number of UA for each crew to spend on equipment (eg,
20UA) chosen from any of the trading posts.

POST-GAME SEQUENCE

1. Extraction
If all your crew made it out, skip this phase. Otherwise, for each
defeated trader, first roll the chance die. If you roll
character is dead and can no longer be used for the rest of the
campaign (their equipment is also lost).

, your

If none of your crew made it out, and you have no other crew
members on board your ship, all your traders must roll on the
You’re On Your Own table.

If they survive, choose one of these options:

RESCUE MISSION
Immediately start a new game with these rules:

•   The board and all non-trader components remain in place from
the last game, including the purge and any other NPCs in play.
The hostility tracker resumes where it left off.

•   All traders fully reload their ammo, may swap any equipment
amongst their crew, and restore 2 health (up to their max).

The game ends as normal. You may only make a rescue mission
once after each game. If a trader is left behind during a rescue
mission, you need to extract them in a different way. Rescue
missions can be played solo, or other players can join in, either to
rescue their own traders or to help you rescue yours.

EMERGENCY TELEPORT
Roll the chance die on the table on page 56 (72 in the Deluxe
Rulebook).

YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN
Roll the chance die on the table on page 57 (73 in the DR).

2. Advancement
Each character that survives a mission and makes it back to the
ship (regardless of whether they completed their objectives) gains
1 career point (fill in the first empty space on their trader board).

This additional point can then also be allocated to a skill you want
to advance on their class board.

If a trader has the Live One kill point counter, they can exchange it
now for an additional career point.

Characters that fail to make it back to their ship during the game
and require extraction afterwards do not gain any career points.

Career points on a trader’s board are in rows, each of which is a
level. Filling all the spaces on a row allows the character to level up.
You can only level up as far as your board allows and if the potential
spaces for stat increases are available.

When level 1 is complete,the trader gains 1 health point and 1 skill
point (and the relevant pegs) for all future games.

When level 2 is complete the trader gains 1 further health point
and 1 further skill point for all future games.

When level 3 is complete the trader gains 1 further health point, 1
further skill point, and 1 action for all future games. This character
is now maxed out and will not advance any further.

3. Trade
Choose one (and only one) trading post to visit from the lists
starting on page 60 (76 in the DR). Stock is limited to the available
tokens. If 2 players go to the same trading post, the winner gets first
pick of any items, alternating thereafter. If there was no winner, flip
the turn counter to see who picks first.

The cost of buying and selling items is on the back of the token: the
first number is the UA you must spend to purchase the item, and
the second number is the UA you will gain when you sell it. Items
with the

 icon are rare and cannot be bought.

Objective tokens with UA values can be sold in the trade phase like
any other item (they cannot be broken or destroyed).

At any time in this phase you may barter with your fellow players.

If you do not have space for any more items in your trader’s item
trays and ship’s hold, you cannot purchase any.

You may also hire crew, but you may never have more than 7.

4. Maintenance
Follow the rules on page 63 (79 in the DR).

Roll the chance die and check for ship system degradation. If any
of a ship’s systems reach 0, the ship becomes damaged beyond
repair. Unless you can repair the ship in this phase, the crew will
disband and will be out of the campaign.

Then make repairs if necessary: it costs 2 UA to fill in 1 space of
your choice in the maintenance area of your ship board. Ship parts
tokens can be spent to make the number of repairs stated on the
token, to the same or different systems.

REACTIONS
Reaction skills are usually used outside of your turn, reacting to an
event or attack made by another character. The trigger condition
for each skill’s use is detailed in its description.

END OF A MISSION
In a campaign, characters left defeated at the end of a mission
must be extracted. If any of their equipment was stolen during the
game, they do not get it back.

•   The player making the rescue may place their ship board in

contact with any airlock door. If multiple crews are taking part,
the winner of the original game places their ship first, followed
by those in clockwise order.

Finally, you may purchase ship upgrades (mark them on both
sides of your ship board/airlock). Available upgrades are scanners,
airlock auto-defences, and docking thrusters, and each has 3
different levels: see page 55 (71 in the DR).

is scored, you may stand back up and restore health equal
to the number of hits. This is your activation for that round.
This can only be done once per game.

Scramble ability: You can climb over objects and scenery,

Massive characters can be seen past/over smaller
characters. Any character with a lower number in their
massive icon, or no icon at all, does not block LoS to
a massive character, but may provide cover. Massive
characters reduce KNOCK BACK attempts against them
by the number shown in the icon. They also add that many
automatic hits to their own KNOCK BACK attempts.

This is the rank of an NPC.

NPCs are now activated in this order: Galactic Corps, Security,
Gangers, Civilians; from highest ranked to lowest rank in each
type. Unless a die roll defines a specific action, NPCs use the
number of actions shown on their boards.

When you activate a NPC type, first check the hostility tracker
to see if any will be automatically spawned, as indicated
by their icon. Roll the chance die to see where they arrive.
If there are multiple NPC types on the hostility tracker, do
not place the next type until you have finished activating the

can make a free CLOSE ASSAULT action against you.

Assault

RANGED ASSAULT attacks cannot be made against
targets engaged with you. If you are engaged with

enemies while making a ranged attack, they may make an
attack of opportunity against you. Choose a ranged weapon and
roll dice depending on the range: numbers in the icon are for
short, medium, and long range. Partial cover reduces the
number of hits by 1 (resolve this before any other modifiers).
Remove an ammo peg.

After the first RANGED ASSAULT action made by a trader in
each round, place the peg in the hostility tracker.

CLOSE ASSAULT attacks can only be made against
enemies in base contact. You may either fight

unarmed (if possible) or choose a close assault weapon. Choose
whether to make a standard hit (first number) or a heavy hit
(second number), and roll that number of dice. Standard hits
ignore

 results. Cover does not apply.

Roll combat dice for the weapon (or use your unarmed stat).
Apply any modifiers such as cover or armour, altering the
number of hits scored. Remaining hits cause damage.

CIVILIANS

Each time you activate a civilian, roll the chance die:

MOVE: The civilian makes a MOVE action in the direction
on the chance die, moving around terrain if necessary.

ATTACK: The civilian makes an ASSAULT action against
the closest target, if any (close assault if engaged,
ranged assault otherwise). They then panic, making 2
MOVE actions in the direction shown on the chance die,
moving around terrain where necessary. If there are no
targets in LoS, the civilian makes a MOVE action in the
direction on the chance die.

HIDE: The civilian makes a MOVE action, moving the
shortest distance possible that would put them in cover
from the nearest visible enemy, moving around terrain
where necessary. If there is no cover available, or there
are no visible enemies, the civilian makes a MOVE action
in the direction on the chance die instead.

JOIN: If there are any traders within short range and LoS,
the civilian joins the crew belonging to the closest. If
there are none within short range, the civilian makes a
MOVE action in the direction on the chance die.

TRADE: The civilian makes a MOVE action towards
the nearest trader in LoS that is not engaged with an
enemy. If they do not reach the trader, they stop. If they
move into contact, they offer a trade. Draw a random
equipment token from the bag; you may choose to keep
it, swap it with an item you already hold, or reject it.
Place any items swapped or rejected in the item slot on
the civilian board, or in the bag if the item slot is full.
If there are no traders in LoS, the civilian makes a MOVE
action in the direction on the chance die, moving around
terrain if necessary.

LIVE ONE: If the hostility tracker is high enough for a Live
One to appear, replace the civilian with a Live One, if
available. If the hostility level is too low, or there are no
Live Ones available, nothing happens.

THE PURGE
Unless a civilian rolls ATTACK, they will not move within 4” of the
purge. If they start their activation within 4” inches of the purge,
any movement they make (if any) must first be made directly
away from the purge, and only once they are out of range will
they continue their selected actions as normal.

Civilians leaving base contact with the purge provoke attacks of
opportunity as normal.

TARGET PRIORITY LIST
Purge first, then gangers or traders (whichever is closest).
Civilians will not attack Galactic Corps, security, or each other
and do not consider these groups enemies. Civilians are never
considered to be enemies except by the purge.

ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY
Moving out of base contact with civilians does not attract an
attack of opportunity.

JOINING CREWS
All NPCs (except the purge) can join trader crews. They are then
part of that crew for all purposes and are no longer considered
an NPC. They are activated in the trader phase by that crew’s
player and can make all available actions as normal (using
the number of actions printed on their card). They retain their
normal statistics for now – do not flip their character board.
If defeated, they are removed from the board and cannot be
revived.

Most NPCs stay fighting with you for the duration of the game.
However the chance die must still be rolled for these civilians in
the NPC phase each round. If you roll JOIN, they change their
minds and revert to being a civilian. If LIVE ONE is rolled, and the
hostility is high enough, the civilian will become a Live One as
usual. All other results are ignored.

CARRYING ITEMS
When an NPC joins a crew, you have the use of their item slot,
for small tokens only. If they were not already carrying an item,
draw one at random from the bag and place it in their item
slot. The NPC cannot use any items themselves, but they will
be available to your other traders using the rules for swapping
items. NPCs can also make search actions and collect
additional items for you during a game.

If a civilian leaves your crew, any item they are carrying remains
in their character board. You can still try to PERSUADE them
to trade it or ATTACK them and take it by force as normal. If an
NPC is defeated, any item they were carrying is left on the floor
where they fell.

PERMANENT HIRES
In a campaign, civilians and gangers that are still part of your
crew and get back to your ship at the end of a mission can be
permanently hired. They are still considered part of your crew
even when they are the only traders left on the board, so if you
wanted to keep them you would continue playing until they
escaped onto your ship or were defeated, as normal. If you
don’t want to hire them permanently, you can end the game
prematurely, leaving them to their fate. Galactic corps and
security cannot be hired permanently.

CIVILIANS

Each time you activate a civilian, roll the chance die:

MOVE: The civilian makes a MOVE action in the direction

targets in LoS, the civilian makes a MOVE action in the
direction on the chance die.

shortest distance possible that would put them in cover

the civilian joins the crew belonging to the closest. If
there are none within short range, the civilian makes a
