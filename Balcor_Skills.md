Ability

Action

This character has a permanent physical armour value equal to the number inside this icon, even when they are not wearing
armour. If they wear armour, they use whichever value is highest.

This character is massive.

Massive characters can be seen past/over smaller characters. Any character with a lower number in their Massive icon, or no
Massive icon at all, will not block LoS to a Massive character, but may provide cover following the normal rules.

Massive characters reduce Knock Back attempts against them by the number shown in the icon. They also add this many
automatic hits to their own Knock Back attempts.

Massive characters can move items (and characters that are smaller than them) at their full speed. Other characters cannot and
do not need to help them. Massive characters themselves require one more character than normal to move them (two characters
to move 2 squares and three to move full speed).

When making a Close Assault action, this player rolls dice equal to the number inside this icon when unarmed. If the Trader
chooses to use a weapon, they use the weapon’s statistics instead.

1  Make a Close Assault action using only your base ability with one extra combat die. If target survives lay it prone.

2

Choose a character you are engaged with that is no bigger than you than you (larger Massive number) and throw them. Move
them into any square within short range and LoS. They suffer no attacks of opportunity from this move. They suffer a two dice
attack, rolling an additional die if a wall or other terrain piece prevented them from being thrown the full distance. Then lay them
prone.
